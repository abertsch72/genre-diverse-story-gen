[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> It began with a bang. A great, primal shriek from an unspeakable god, that tore the night sky apart from the center. All in all, the universe seemed to be shattered, until at the right time of an ever-increasing chorus. <newline> <newline> The god of the heavens was furious, enraged. The other gods, his allies and the gods he had summoned, were left with no choice but to do the same. The universe had turned against them. They began to devour everything in sight as they made their attack. But then.... <newline> <newline> Then, they were nothing. All of the cosmos was reduced to a single, black nothingness. Except for one thing. A lone, shimmering, star.
[ WP ] You are the head of a drug cartel <endprompts> You can't help but remember the times when you hadn't seen him for a while. How the streets could be so quiet ; how everyone would be in a hurry. You could tell it 'd been going on for so long, the fear. People had gotten better, but it's no longer that easy to stay away. <newline> <newline> I met Hector at my apartment complex ; I was already working my shifts as a maintenance man. His company had been struggling in recent years, the last of the government contracts ran out. So this was my chance to join the
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I'm so sorry about that. I should've known that would happen. They used me to keep the world safe, but they used me so I could help them with their crimes. When they had me on my feet, they used me so they could get what they wanted. They didn't have to hurt people, they could be happy just having me in their midst. You know how that felt to them, right? I mean, they probably thought I was a superhero. But the first time I tried being their superhero, they used me for their own benefit, not for their own. So I quit. I quit. I quit. I'm glad that's the last time I 'll ever try it. <newline> <newline> ( I swear I'm not sorry. This was fun and all, but it was also pretty harsh on me. )
[ WP ] `` I am... '' <endprompts> The cold of the winter, the cold of the autumn, the cold of the winter season, they're all familiar to him. He has been trapped here for years, a ghost. <newline> <newline> For a long time he has sat in a dark corner. For an almost as long time he has been unable to see or move. <newline> <newline> It's been years since he was able to get outside. And he has seen far too many things for
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I was lost, a mere man, a mere man. I lost my mind. I found my feet upon the ground, my head upon the pillow. My limbs were tied, and I watched as my friends and family sat around me. My heart, and soul, and mind were being ripped out. I was becoming something. <newline> <newline> `` Don't feel too guilty about the whole thing. The whole time I didn't know you, '' I said. <newline> <newline> My eyes had been fixed onto the window of the small room. The rain was falling. I remember the smell of it, but the memory was all blurred. I don't know what was so interesting about this room, but it was so beautiful I didn't even try to remember where it was. <newline> <newline> A knock. A voice. It was so familiar, so calm. `` Don't let it get to you, '' the voice said. I could feel her grip tighten on my face, on my sanity. `` It was just a mistake, '' she said. `` It was a mistake. Your parents didn't understand. '' <newline> <newline> That was the worst thing about being lost. <newline> <newline> `` You can't forget me, '' she continued. `` I want to. '' <newline> <newline> And that was
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> `` I'm gon na be so angry. '' <newline> <newline> It was late evening and the house on the outskirts of town was buzzing. There was nobody on the porch and nobody outside the window with them. Just his parents, but that didn't matter. The car was in the driveway. A young woman hadn't even stopped at the gas station, and was already going to the back parking lot, getting ready for the car she was driving. <newline> <newline> She was young and beautiful and strong, a pretty one too. Her father was tall, muscular, had some of the big eyes people saw in boys but was otherwise pretty. Her mother had an infectious charisma, and she made him laugh. The boys knew they were in love and the whole situation had made everyone happy. <newline> <newline> She knew they had to leave but was too tired. She had a boyfriend of sorts. His name was Michael and the two had just settled into an apartment together after he 'd moved the previous week. <newline> <newline> `` Come on, I want you to drive. Don't tell anyone, you're scared of me, '' his dad had said. <newline> <newline> `` Don't be so scared. I know. '' <newline> <newline> They drove for a couple of blocks and her mother stopped to check up on him
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> The moon never lies. <newline> <newline> My childhood was plagued with lies ; the moon has the same power for the stars, it is never, ever, true. I heard stories of an ancient temple that burned and was soon swallowed in fire. A time when people were born with wings. It was one of the stories of the time of the moon, it was the time of magic, when people could cast spells from the sky. It was the time the people were born that made the stars seem more real than ever before. The moon was the first true magic in history. <newline> <newline> My family has always been one of the least trusted families. The people there do not care for us. The only reason why I can still be able to eat and sleep is the knowledge that my mother still feeds me every night. She is not dead, but she has not found the strength to go out to the wild and play with her children any longer. <newline> <newline> I hear the stories of other people, but it is all so false. I am a failure, I wasn't really born into an abusive home and I never had an abusive dad. I had two parents who died before they were allowed to raise me, a mother who was killed in front of me and a father who would kill a stray cat in his yard at any minute. No, those were not my real parents and they were never actually my
