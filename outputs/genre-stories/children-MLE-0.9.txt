[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> It began with a bang. A great, huge bang. Not a sound of glass breaking, nothing like the thunderous bangs people heard over the course of the day. A giant ball of fire. A few small craters were left in the rock. The people there didn't have any trouble getting their own weapons to get the fire off them. Most of them were lucky the bullets landed on metal, so that they weren't stuck there forever. It's what the ancient Chinese said about living in a metal box for eternity. And that was what happened that day. <newline> <newline> We're not sure how many people died. Probably not a big deal if you count the fire that came from where the explosion took place. The sky was dark with smoke and flames everywhere. People got so used to the sound of the explosion that the people didn't feel it. It wasn't a bang or even a blast of fire. It was a sound. <newline> <newline> The sound came from the back of a dark van. The van was on fire and the person inside was unconscious. We don't know what caused the fire in the van, it's not like they were on fire or anything. It happened so fast though, so quickly and so quickly we lost track of who was dead or alive. I'm not sure if that was the right word, I'm sure it wasn't.
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I'm so sorry about that. I don't think I can go on like this. I know the words you've heard many times now. But I have to do it one last time, and I don't have time to give you my blessing. This is my last chance to do it. I can do it by myself. <newline> <newline> My wife and I have been married two years now. We were married for nearly 15 of those years, the first time I met her was when I was 18. It had been years since the first time we had made love, but I know she was always there for me in every way possible. For the first week I thought I was losing her. I felt like she was gone, like I was going to have to leave. She was my everything, she was who I was supposed to be with. I felt betrayed by her. I couldn't understand the way she made me feel so bad about her, but I knew I shouldn't let that affect me. I could never be with someone I knew I loved. That's why I felt like I shouldn't be leaving her. I don't know what I should have done though. All I know is I didn't want to, and I didn't care, I didn't want to feel the hurt she made me feel. But I did. I needed to get her back. <newline>
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I was lost, a mere man with a mind like a thousand stones. I found myself sitting at a wooden table, with my head in my hands. I was thirsty. <newline> <newline> The table was warm. I needed to drink to stay awake and to avoid the cold. I decided to go to the sink to wash my face. But the sink was empty. A boy was in the water. The boy looked up and down at me in amazement as the water ran over his head. He was wearing nothing. His bare feet were covered by a thin layer of mud. <newline> <newline> The boy began to cry. I had heard him before. He had been a lonely child, and this boy would not have any company. I looked away from him and back to the table. I didn't like the boy's tears. So I returned to the sink, and then, I washed my face again. The boy came back to the table, and again cried.

[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> There is no room for doubt in our collective mind. <newline> The same will be true in mine. <newline> <newline> There is no room for doubt in our collective mind. <newline> The same will be true in yours. <newline> <newline> We aren't that different.
[ MP ] This is how I feel when I look at a girl in a blue dress, on a date at a bar with an old man I don't know, and we're both dancing and eating pizza at a local restaurant. <endprompts> My eyes met the sky, like the clouds weren't there to distract me and there was an actual sky above. I can ’ t believe I did that. <newline> The sky itself is a great sky to see, the color is so blue it ’ s impossible to believe that it was only yesterday. I didn ’ t even notice the colors until the moment I walked into that bar. It was raining when I entered the place and it didn ’ t stop for the two days that I was there. I still can ’ t believe it. The place itself is pretty far in the distance and the bar itself is close enough but the view was so far away. My best friend and I were already at the bar and it was just me and her on the table in front of us so the table was empty and I could see the
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> The moon never lies. She's always there, ever moving and ever bright, yet she always holds nothing back. She shines for the stars, but as always, she has a heart, too. <newline> <newline> A mother in the city knows how to be careful about the people. It's no matter how much she is taught the right things, how to keep the city safe from crime and the gangs of the outside. It's one of the few things that she has to hold back. As long as the people are safe from crime, she can stay out in the night and do what she has to do to protect her city. But she has her limits, her responsibilities don't let her. <newline> <newline> It's that kind of night when she sees her son for the first time. She is not ready yet, she's still trying to find her own balance between the two. If she can even call him such, he is only a few years old. He would understand all the wrong things she has to do to keep a city from collapsing, but he is too young for such. He could easily be manipulated and he would soon find out that the only way out of this is to face her responsibilities, like the good mother she is, and embrace her responsibility, no matter how much you hate it. He would need to learn the right thing, too. He knows how to make it right.
