[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> It began with a bang the first morning, an audible boom from an unfamiliar direction. The world went quiet the night after, but no one saw a thing. The earth was untouched by anything since, until today. <newline> <newline> As day breaks there isn't a lot to worry about. It ’ s the usual for these times : It ’ s summer, it's rainy and it ’ s cold. People stay at school in what the government expects to be in full and will not tolerate under any conditions. But what happened that day? <newline> <newline> *He fell at a stop. We do not know what caused his fall nor what it was used to be called but someone in front of his car made a startling impact and he fell over the side with one leg dangling over his head. He landed several inches onto his seat, causing him to topple. Someone in the car had hit him twice. I hadn't expected this!! How could such an old man get in a collision with his rear end… It almost took him over and he fell face up. I am the one who fixed this thing so no longer should be the same old problem. I think now that he ’ ll want it done!! I can ’ t stay by his side anymore! <newline> <newline> The whole world is looking into that black car with a broken engine. It ’ s so obvious
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I stared at my feet before heading towards the elevator. *It could get lonely. They used to do it like this a hundred years before. Back when we were still stuck with our big big stupid machines, * I muttered with a chuckle. *Let ’ s try some others. There ’ s plenty to do on here, by myself? * <newline> <newline> I pressed my foot against the accelerator when I remembered that my train ’ s destination wasn ’ t my family. I ’ d had two trains stop by here before, but all for their daughter at my station just now. My heart sank. The girl in the seat in front of the small door on the side would be coming to bed soon. How pathetic. Not just for getting me home before I even stopped running my mind raced over options ; maybe something better, like a job or college? My vision suddenly filled with more images ; maybe we could get into some serious shit on an airplane. That probably worked. I leaned away slowly, almost expecting my feet to drop right along with me. Or maybe it never would- my thoughts went down a bit. <newline> <newline> I let my heels grind down heavily in earnest as the platform loomed just beside the elevator-way, its golden rail serving as my last defense and my last hope, my salvation to make matters right on either. My gaze slid toward the doors, scanning them for evidence. I couldn
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I woke up, aching at the cold, sharp taste in my mouth from sleeping. I had a bad dream, about my roommate from the last semester being kidnapped by monsters that had gone loose overnight in our dorm room. We had run the whole week hoping to stop them... but by mid Monday, there were 3 of them. But they weren't a pack of hungry mice with bitey fangs in our dorm windows. Instead, I guess the whole thing was in full swing when suddenly the monster outside my window exploded through my door. When he finally arrived inside of my tiny apartment, his teeth, gums, scales, eyes, fur, blood, a dozen more had grown all together. <newline> He bit right through my couch, but it quickly closed down like everything before before it because something held his throat. I let out loud, in an effort to stop whatever he was in. But his face broke apart before my arms ever fully wrapped around him and suddenly blood dripped up down and on to his hand. We both stood on shaky knees, clutching into anything we could reach. But after the redness drained off of his head and everything turned gray and he passed out. And the rest is the story of how we died. <newline> Edit : Formatting errors!

[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> `` Where did your dog go, Mom? '' <newline> <newline> My mother blinked, the sweat coming out the back of her neck like fog. There was something on her arm - my favorite one! This was her favorite spot, the one that smelled like pine - an unspoken reminder when Daddy went off to sleep and she couldn't get out of bed. How wonderful - at just 8 she was a pretty thing on top of this, she seemed like only 4 years younger than Daddy. <newline> <newline> Mom turned around from a nearby table at her dinner to me. My old, wooden house, still in its heyday : an oak framed oak and covered in an intricate array of colors ; we bought both of us for our first anniversary last weekend - the house was almost unrecognizable as the new place Dad always came for Mom. I do not really remember a thing that night ; it was only a few of days ago when I thought `` Daddy will be there soon, '' until everything was a blur when my old dad called Dad out, `` How many weeks!? Are you sick or something again? `` I thought. Oh God... Daddy is going down! `` I will be okay, '' he would always promise. Dad called up Mom, asking about what had happened and to see `` How do you like her again, baby? ``. He asked me and I just stood there, waiting and watching him fall down the stairs...

[ CW ] Tell a story from beginning to conclusion in 8 paragraphs. <endprompts> You were a loner child before you met Dad, and that made it hard. We had a hard time. But when the first car, with white, and blue stripes all the way to the top of the hood crashed through the garage... then everything seemed right. This kid was so happy about seeing the first car that we all kept a tight routine. Everyone who knew of us didn't understand exactly how everything would play out. Our personalities just played to them to figure out how all of this worked. <newline> <newline> Dad wouldn't always understand. <newline> <newline> He always wanted more toys, things like those stupid ball-ties which my brother gave me, toys that Dad was going to put me in at age 7 or 8 when the ball would catch up to my skull every day and pull
