[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> It began with a bang the first morning, an audible boom from an unfamiliar direction. The world went quiet the night after, but no one saw a thing. The earth was untouched by anything since. There remained few to no signs of life being reported from our location, which now lies on a far, away ocean. It was assumed only survivors would see such an odd sight. Then the sound came once more, this time with no warning to anything that was present at the time but the earth was completely leveled in an instant. The sky turned ashen white. In front of me on our bed there appears an odd shadow floating silently from a small crater which has no depth to it, yet no sign of a cause. An eery hum fills the dark house, echoing through the silence and making it all much harder to understand what I think to be an ethereal being who has appeared above me with its own message. <newline> <newline> We both froze with our heads hung, looking for an answer to what exactly could be in front of our backs. A large dark shadow approaches my back. As a child this did make some interesting noises. Once I 'd had a chance, in the same quiet moment as a shadow now approaches that form - I let out a wince and jump for my phone and my phone begins vibrating furiously. <newline> <newline> `` Hello? Hello! Are you alright? We need you! '' <newline>
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> `` One time, '' he spat with disdain and contempt. His fingers found its way across his lips with force like two old masters working furiously at the same project. All it took was a tiny piece of parchment and their work would stand as legend if their fingers had stayed clean. <newline> A thousand men toiled under his supervision of countless times over. A billion cycles had rolled by and all that could compare was when two brothers would clash upon each other ’ s knees over the crown the first time. Every blade was tempered in death by years of laboring together, all for their own amusement. <newline> <newline> The man in the throne spoke up : `` Yes and that is because..., ” <newline> “ Not yet. They will be back '' <newline> They watched and murmured into each other ’ s helmets while the man with the red visor adjusted his cape, adjusting the cloth. No one could ever have matched the patience of their overseer, nor could ever truly stand up to this man ’ s will. Every blade was sharpened into shape as their lord fought on. <newline> <newline> For a little while then all was in relative peace. “ What have we learned tonight, old man? ”

[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I woke up, aching at the cold, sharp taste in my mouth from sleeping. A gentle stream of sweat dripped from my shoulders over the comforter and splashed down like water from a puddle of wet snow onto my ungracefully wrinkled face... It's as if there was an earthquake... No it probably wasn't a one. My hand grabbed the handle of one of my cars windows. If my right window was still left in, that will be all fine, I don't know what caused the damage anyway... It was just black and red before something appeared through my eyes. I remember clearly, `` Oh, shit, a giant monster! How did we do that thing not do anything right before? It would have killed any humans on Earth in such small a space, so how the heck did he stay above us in an enclosed area until someone woke from under it with his rifle drawn and dropped something through ours which can only be described as blood. That was terrifying and we fell onto the floor for just another moment when a wave of terror struck. Before long, they were both away in another dimension.. I awoke suddenly, in the middle of what appears to have been Central Park downtown and I see the massive beast, it's jaw was like lead from its point and I had a feeling... something must be the wrong and I was just like some animal of God to go to see him, no... Not exactly what is expected, what
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> `` Where did your god know about our ship being on the moon from? Did you really think that the space agencies thought it would never happen '' he asked incredulously. `` How do we know of aliens? '' he exclaimed with such rage when his colleague gave him that little lecture. The alien, an android like most humanoid aliens that Earth and even most space agencies used on planets, was simply staring at the scientists'screen to report their results on finding the object near our planet `` The Human Lunar Module '' it spoke as though its mouth should be filled and spewed every nanofocal. `` Are we to put the object, if you will, at the moon or another such point within your star system and report an incident involving intelligent species... we must investigate this new fact '' they said <newline> The aliens had their ship ready and the android was now the only human the earth knew outside of the alien `` The data on it was only a preamble. If you want further info you could download data which will come with a manual `` Report The Incident '' you should have heard this much already. As your planet's best intelligence experts on alien craft you should understand its new species the android speaks as if being the leader and not commander '' he stated to both of his staff who could read and understand their thoughts <newline> `` As our expert witness explained its species looks like an advanced civilization compared even the apes and us so i am going into a classified section about its
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> Every other city on Earth has the equivalent of Hell, it had an equivalent and yet somehow no matter how many people come here there is simply something that is as terrifying, horrifying even though there seems little danger of getting here <newline> or ever seeing again from within or without your city. <newline> It happens everyday on a scale of hundreds of millions of little events throughout our lives that no one could understand when looking into their faces but they could, they feel the gravity of what has occuring throughout their lives, it was like having the sun to them for all of its heat was akin to that moment where the only color you could have chosen was red before you could truly see the color of it. <newline> You're at the hospital bed, the woman is lying and dying with her blood running to an apparent untreated abscess through the chest. Some of her nurses have gone into shock trying desperately to help but to no avail and all she knows to do now is die, or get another blood vessel and you are the only living individual remaining on this bed which to them had somehow never been a part of human lives and therefore you knew nothing. <newline> It had always scared the humans around her. Some claimed it was a fear to themselves but others felt like it felt like the humans are being squeezed until your body no longer belongs to you but it doesn't matter. She was stuck in pain, dying and they looked on helplessly and knew
