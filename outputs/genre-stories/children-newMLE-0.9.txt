[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> It began with a bang. A great, thundering boom from an enormous hole. The world went quiet and the earth trembled as millions of pieces of debris crumbled. A giant ball of fire shot out from the hole in the sky and began raining down on people. The city was instantly obliterated. Buildings were smashed to pieces, the people panicked. People ran for their lives but, even though everyone was running out of options, there was one that didn't have any. <newline> <newline> The man sitting in front of me wasn't just any man, he was one of the most renowned scientists of the time. And as he stared at me, his eyes were a dull red and his expression a deadpan somber one. <newline> <newline> “ Listen, I think we ’ ve found what we were looking for, there ’ s nothing to worry about. All we can do now is let it happen. ” <newline> <newline> “ How could you not have been aware of this? Are you some sort of god-like being? A higher power? I don ’ t understand, why would you let it happen? ” <newline> <newline> “ I can ’ t explain it. What I can tell you is that it is the end of time. ” <newline> <newline> I had to swallow hard. �
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I'm so sorry about that. I should've known that would happen. They used me to keep the world safe, but they used me so I could help them with their crimes. When they had me on my feet, they used me so they could get what they wanted. They didn't have to hurt people, they could be happy just having me in their midst. You know how that felt to them, right? I mean, they probably thought I was a superhero. But the first time I tried being their superhero, they used me for their own benefit, not for their own. So I quit. I quit. I quit. I'm glad that's the last time I 'll ever try it. <newline> <newline> ( A little background on me. I am an engineer. I was the best at my job, which is why I always seemed so calm when they used me. I'm now retired, but when the first criminal was captured, I knew I 'd be able to help them. I could've sworn that I was there, but now I'm sorry. I should've been more careful )

[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> I was lost, a mere man, a mere man. I lost my mind. I found my feet upon the ground, my head upon the pillow. My limbs were tied, and I watched as my friends and family sat around me. My heart, and soul, and mind were being ripped out. I was becoming something. <newline> <newline> Then, a light. A very bright light. It pierced my eyes and I didn't know where I was going. The light blinded me. <newline> <newline> I was now a black man, a dark man, a being. I was an animal, and I was a being that had lived among us. <newline> <newline> When I saw myself, I thought myself to be dead. It is not so. I am alive, though. It is an honor to serve with my best friend.
[ MP ] In the shade of a fallen tree <endprompts> When the sun rose again on the eastern side of the field, she knew what she had to do. For two days she had been in pursuit. The enemy were moving towards her. She knew what she had to do. If she kept her distance and turned back, they would all be dead before she got close enough to strike. <newline> <newline> She stood, alone. Two men were already advancing at her with torches, swords drawn. One of them, a man
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> There is no room for doubt, even in our great halls. There is one true faith, one creed, one idea. Only the light of the sun shines bright. There is only one true cause and one sole end ; for it is a single light, but that does not account for our other lights and their paths. <newline> <newline> This light never fades. It never fades from sight. It never fades from the view of the world, even in our darkest darkest shadows. It never fades into our mind, and even in our darkest moments it never fades. When you look at me now, it is not the light, but the very essence of our existence that I can no longer see. This light is ever-present in our hearts. I can not see the light anymore because it is not here, nor does the world know. I can only see the light, and yet the light that isn't here. I am the light. <newline> <newline> I see nothing. That light isn't always on the end of the hallway, yet it is not here anymore. It is always on the end of the hallway, and always gone. Sometimes you see me as the light, but sometimes you can see all of this light. I don't know what is behind me, but I do know that it does not exist anymore. That it has left us for once, forever, without ever becoming light again. I see it
[ WP ] One time, <endprompts> The moon never lies. <newline> <newline> My childhood was plagued with lies ; the moon has the same power for the stars, it is never, ever black, but you see the blackness everywhere. We never knew the real, for the lies were too great. And we were just so young, and so naive, when we would see the moon in the sky and then the truth, so different. But there it is now. It is there, the brightest that has ever laid the stars that made us wonder, and the lies are gone from our minds. <newline> <newline> The moon has seen more stars in it's lifetime than any other. This planet, this whole universe, has never seen the moon before. <newline> <newline> When the universe had a chance to make a mistake, the moon was not one of them. This universe was not just a little piece of the cosmos, but a whole. The truth will always remain, the universe will always be open to the moon, but not for us. We, the naive ones, the few, still had to hide from the truth. We hid in our beds and pretended that nothing bad could befall us. And yet there it is. The truth.
