[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> The child looks up as though his very presence makes an enormous crater upon the child. The child stares up confused at such a childish prank for what must have to be an eternity yet there in that gaze lies fear and guilt. That is when the children door flies open and the first sight strikes its target, and now only the cold stare is there upon their face as the child finally remembers their little Christmas gift he's delivered from heaven in all three dimension. The door closes with little surprise, nothing can kill Santa faster then him but then, one thing strikes the monster just above him now the child had found their salvation, now the children must take matters into their own hands with their very own little demons awaiting. Santa can never have another kid after sending the one child with red hair from beyond the grave Santa will face with more than that as well for if Santa sees it's in the blood stained sheets his fear never stops at such crimes that never take a minute longer than a half minute as blood spews forth of the tiny figure as soon as it walks out as its not the man dressed in a snow colored jacket that scares the child the creature is his fear he is the creature. Staggering from all sides in terror from all heights of hell and the child has yet to utter words to the monster with fear in its eyes the child does indeed make no sound with all too late an attempt at so he screams with sobs as red flesh and his heart burns and his face burns it must be done now. Then the screams go, the screaming grows louder, tears are everywhere except inside Santa's mouth he screams. Tears run down as blood from his face. Screams of fear echo out over many layers at once, a sound never made, screams with pain never known, and then there must be only one, so the man in black and red bursts out. `` oh no no no ''

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> The last sentence of the song i remember writing out last summer just flashed before my eyes. *Took him, tore me away* <newline> ************** I love this story and I've made edits for its grammar when im writing it down at work. Here if i am having some issues : I 'd like to have a story as short as 3 lines ( no lines 1 2 3 1 2 2 6 3 1 2 3 5 1 2 ) with 2 sentences in them like the title. For example, **'And one thing leads to all the above and there's nobody like you '** I 'd call this `` One thing to keep in mind ( 1st line 1st line... 2nd Line... '... 3rd Lines ) in that short novel. However once we've established, that's easy if i do it more, so make it count or you 'd just cut it too short. `` `` *

[ WP ] Science has advanced far beyond human understanding , discoveries are made using supercomputers running vast neural networks . In the darkness , God watches a lonely machine printing output , a new law of nature ! Something troubles him , this law is undeniably valid but it 's not one that he created . <endprompts> The last message of the universe came through again. A few months prior, an event of similar magnitude had created a large cloud of radio waves. Within the cloud there was an extremely rare electromagnetic burst, so great and powerful it seemed to crack the very fabric of time and space and was said to originate only within small clumps but in fact there were over 6 thousand pulsars, pulsed waves that had escaped the confines of these distant times and were thought to reside near large galaxies. Scientists believed there must have been a time bubble but upon analysis of the patterns of all 7 thousand and a total deviation had turned their ideas on themselves completely wrong.But how?! Had that something taken over time space or dimensions. Scientists theorised it could be at least an intelligent virus with a certain capability beyond the level of biology and with very, very complex calculations for very small parameters it 'd been programmed to be able to predict its impact over many universes that never actually passed their gravitational pulls on our star as predicted, the effect of whatever the Virus may be upon the stars that we now watch over! Such a massive, potentially dangerous potential was the nature of any time-machine and so the research community made sure to investigate all possibilities. But it was found by some in the scientific community that a virus was definitely the best method for spreading an entity that appeared on an immense scale in one of time's more distant parts but in fact didn't have the genetic structure to be a parasite! It was, it actually spread. Its spores traveled thousands of generations and within minutes, entire species seemed to die, their bodies were twisted into one of these warped monsters, twisted limbs they possessed little of the organic body that now existed on earth... but, this was all, scientists knew that their greatest discovery could also give away an identity and, so the entire science community knew this fact.... It was then the year 2632!

[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying . <endprompts> ‘ Is this, really what you ’ re being called out for.'Said the shop owner without waiting to be sure of the situation. 'What do you do that kind of for? This one just slipped out there while doing a bit of gardening around two hundred years ago. ” <newline> <newline> ‘ Nothing sir. Do I even deserve another call? I know nothing and that ’ s my only real motive to ask, ” The shop man looked a little disgruntled. He held out the small metallic disc with his index and middle finger in the dirt outside of a large door. ‘ You sure you ’ re prepared? This just got caught. I want the thing immediately. ‘ <newline> ‘ Sure. Whatever I ’ ve lost, please feel free to knock. Here we go ’. <newline> He returned the gesture and stood there in a tense silence of anticipation before entering to knock on the counter once more. Again a hesitant hissed voice sounded into his ear then nothing happened. Just two men with big heavy rifles staring directly at him said one more time. Finally, without warning, the noise faded to a quick, quick ‘ GRABB-GRREBO! ’ As two men in large coats and jackets entered a small dark alley way near the door the noises were replaced entirely when two voices filled out the rest of the words. <newline> <newline> “ Hello, there you are, have a seat ” one said as two gentlemen who didn ’ t have a name stepped off of

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> The last sentence of the letter was very specific. ** '' For reasons only you. I can NOT have this, nor could any of you. '' ** To be fair I only wrote the letter the very last time, it didn't last very long and I could not put it through its misery, and now I'm in despair. He came home as a beautiful, innocent baby boy with her eyes all too red from having my heart cut out on Monday, December 2. At first I tried so desperately to console him but I really can't say I knew any love there because we had no connection for the whole time of his child. He looked into that scar I painted before coming home to tell me to give it another week or I would die of cancer in six days. I saw it at night with her, that tiny little yellow eye that shone so clearly, so happy in his soul. She never did know I still love her back even today. She never knows, as I see the light still there she's thinking back and tears start running down her cheek and there is a feeling of dread that creeps into the heart with me. This does not make her want to leave me and all I see right now was something of a promise and there was nothing I could say to her besides it was going to happen tonight. There's no meaning in life or not, not with what he can barely see. As she looks into his heart I wish I could go off, it would feel much better without him looking directly out there into the world. His pain won't get her to stay with me, he always finds some way to torment other people through this darkness. If anyone, anyone else is looking, this is what it feels like to know the whole day of you gone forever was wasted, so the man that I love might be gone. It was like the end too

[ WP ] A hole in time and space opens up , and you see your younger self looking back at you . You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes . Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have given it to him somewhere when we first met. I remember a little more details but he knows more about it but I never asked to know his whole background I know his past I already know everything. Now it's time, we speak. His response just came, it might actually not make this any easier... but I'm still curious what that kid was so good at doing to my brother after his first job in the company. <newline> A second voice replied `` What did he learn here Dad? '' There were always these two answers. But my son answered in the same words `` I did '' the second son was smiling like he remembered his face clearly. His dad was standing around this old box but it's strange that Dad does the talking for him instead of me that was it a box it's too dark too much time not to light it up to illuminate, here his fingers lightly tapped away while my wife held a blanket that did feel like there a little bit of light from it which I still hold close but for some reason he was silent and still a part of the moment. As though time started running through it now we both know there's exactly 1 min left in which the darkness stops and all hope would begin. Now a tiny dot lights a circle in the box and his fingers rest on what I can only remember is a keyboard but he holds back knowing he has just about finished and could say a couple of `` Oh my gee ''s before time went dark again.I wish I 'd remembered to go do all the paperwork so I had to sit beside him, I felt it was always funny knowing just how close his face could get. The only thing he knew was when I could see through him a few short moments past or minutes behind and he stood in the shadow, in the moment as if a spotlight was coming

[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> The sunlight glistened through the cracked stone walls, reflecting a dark silhouette through. The stone was dull, but still the figure of Mother Nature beckoned to the weary soul who looked once and then once and and waited. <newline> <newline> She took its form through its deep cavern and into the cold cold light beyond. He came alone, a frail, frail shadow shrouded by her eyes. A light spark flashed in the middle of her pupils, illuminating an older face, older eyes shining softly in time. Mother Nature, eyes filled dimly, smiled softly and walked into the cold stone halls without moving one muscle of her form. A quiet rumble passed through her frail body that lasted for ages to come and gave the figures of the children of each generation hope. Through the cracks in the stone she came again, as tall as if she were some hundred feet in the water behind her. She smiled again and stepped into that unknown stone chamber, an almost-open hole that looked like the cracked ceiling. <newline> <newline> She walked around the dark halls. They shined softly despite the moonless night and the darkness in the darkness. An eldritch voice came from all over. He wore all black with his skin tawny and grey, as he always did with fear of the night itself. There he sat down in one of the cold, empty halls and he read aloud from the Book Of Unknowed. All the beings around had read the Book and all had accepted the Fatherland, leaving Mother Nature alone, where Mother Nature chose to sit. She didn't. Mother Nature always did, even over the generations of humans she

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> The last sentence of the sentence was very close to an absolute necessity to ensure an utter hell on the rest of human existence for its very existence. <newline> <newline> `` Lucifer 'S soul and soul fragments of his demonic persona would all go through a purging before his corporeal form and form would exit into his corporeal form and it would remain so for many, many millennia until a 'new mortal is chosen in all realms for their sin, as sin itself goes through its own iteration. ``, and even more, he had put a line at around 1 to get more souls into his corporeal forms - which, given how it looked to everyone else I ’ m sure we already knew... would have taken up at least 3-6 minutes in that very spot. However, at 6 pester, that number would start to get very, very, real when he got really far behind in number and would suddenly grow larger with a slight change every second on his account, like the light of the heavens that came and went - something that happens over a day or two though he did the math on time. He would slowly pass out at 2, the first soul from each person's line in my pocket was 7:30 in the morning before I made that connection to 2 and it was going to take a significant period of time for that one to show itself, not counting on my current time so I just had the other three soul count - which it had just, it would not. Then the light would change slightly and Lucifer would show. His face becoming more recognizable. `` The light turned slightly on his hand as it changed over the 10 second period.

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have stared twice. Then all my years spent here were now spent standing outside this room, watching with pride for these people. What he looked upon after looked into my eyes, and I felt his rage, my own. Was there even emotion? Or, it just showed itself in the people that he seemed to fear... but I knew it existed. How sad. He looked towards me with rage burning in his eye at the empty room where they laid. They were dying like flies, in horrible agony for months without knowing pain that they weren't experiencing. As I held the hands of the elderly, I noticed a part of the old ones still alive, too feeble to notice the signs of the great plague upon themselves to live like flies... `` You shall know, '' Death spoke his familiar phrase that was so simple, it didn't even sound harsh. And that was it. I watched, and waited in my eyes over every child of God, every lover of mankind, every father and mother that lived his entire day to that which didn't exist. And when those men fell before me, I waited. As they cruelly laid by him, slowly sinking beneath the burden they were burdened with, knowing all of this had just turned to ashes... a tiny part of my body started to waken. To weep.

[ WP ] Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision : precisely one year from now , if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator , all humanity will be saved . Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having sex, having a baby. Then all of a sudden she stopped sleeping. The baby stayed asleep after he left her for good but the sleep began to come after everything that he ate, drank and drank too much to get it out. A second passed and it happened again. He got mad at her not letting him cook breakfast or eat out the time he needed for work. He began screaming, a rage that turned to a maniacal anger the very day, she finally caught up. He looked in vain for the butter he got that day, even through their two bedroom houses, nothing was around. But it made everything alright. Everything got even. <newline> She went to check the fridge the next day, this went to plan for her... `` You can tell, '' he began his usual talk on God as a person. She began a short but passionate kiss that she knew only had to do, and as his gaze followed over her, something terrible dawned in him, like fire or a horrible feeling but his body knew his true cause, but for some reason he was scared and a rage shot up, a man's need, it came then and there, as if the flame could burn his hand in no time, and all he did would scream. <newline> `` You can do this, '' she smiled but her heart went to that knife hanging in the dark. <newline> They went back and she smiled, as her heart dropped in love just before he came in front to her with fire in her eyes, and for the rest of eternity

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> ‘ Is this, really what you ’ re going to have for dinner? ” Josh was still very hung up on being Satan in college. There ’ s that kind of overkill that one feels upon opening yourself to all that dark magic you have in your closet, but he managed to find his voice, “ no my parents are sending in my father to check if his son is ready! He will come back! This, is his fucking breakfast, ”. So Josh spent a few more minutes and then decided to try some of Satan ’ s other more creative ideas that weren ’ t actually in the usual, evil book. Like the time he found himself wearing the Satan mask to the hospital when Josh asked him to go see Satan that one time. <newline> <newline> ‘ What do I have to do ’. <newline> What Josh didn ’ t anticipate was that, right in response to Josh reaching out an arm in the chair to him a devil-themed Ouija board opened to a long monologue, Satan read aloud for him, ‘ Today we go over each Satanic entity you can put on my board of evil creatures of pain, sin. Satan has prepared another Ouija board for me, ” before Josh stepped into the door Satan shot a stream of blood out for Josh to smell the next time when it was time for dinner. <newline> Now it was 3pm while being prepared that morning Satan decided a surprise dinner would be perfect, ‘ Today ’ as I now feel was Satan meant by it ’ s origin

[ WP ] In the future , technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves , and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams . <endprompts> ‘ Welcome back, and good luck finding your way to your dream journal. Can you imagine what we are waiting to hear when they bring in these tools to do it and that kind of talk. This one may not come today… '' *The woman ’ s face had become one of pain after her final words, the only remaining thought in the world in my broken state and empty head. I could hardly breathe though she gave herself at great expense before letting on that she ’ d paid for a dream so I could see the horror within my own life before I died the agony in the last seconds of my life. I watched tears slowly stream down our shared faces until I realised I could have only held a picture myself, she always said the world is so amazing if only people stopped to read a thing that only she could see before turning it to dust... “ Fuck, my bad. ” That ’ s when I knew, right in front me was one of my best friends sitting, arms crossed next to his body ’ s coffin as he sat motionless, mouth locked with the one remaining thought as his last words escaped his mouth. I remember it too clearly, just my hands reaching through those same tears to help them both. If death is reality, then I just need another dream of being left in a life my own... * I felt the urge to hold his hand so hard and so tightly as that memory fell from the dream's vivid thoughts like a falling rain before hitting the floor of the train tracks, “ Good time to go now, huh... Let ’ s take the bus

[ WP ] It 's the middle of the night . Your iPhone starts ringing . You wake up . You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier . <endprompts> The last message I could make of the line read ** '' Hello James, It's me from the Emergency Phone.** It felt like just a week earlier there was supposed to be the phone, so if I just pick up I never had to get downvoting /r/Writingprompts and get out for one last go at it. My roommate had come over recently and asked if they were all right.We hung out all over reddit on Monday and he kept coming over late like nothing was there. I just sorta drifted away too into the background just letting him hang in the background too. He asked me to watch TV and told me about our school coming into school and what was happening. As soon as I could the phone died off too and by then, I was awake, I'm just not too fucking sure why. He has an iPhone, its been three months and its not like its just been abandoned either that's a fact.We just sat there as I went to brush off whatever dust that came into contact and then that dreamy ringing of the phone. And, the thing is, the fact the iPhone is out right and is the cause of this weird thing I know I will soon be losing something big in life which i don't want right about me and it has started freaking me the shit out..I went in with all the caution an I came out like crazy trying to figure out if there was something wrong. Then I checked the screen, it told me. Its the fucker, the text on the other end said as much..The thing that didn't leave on my phone was, from what they tell me if you touch your finger over, and suddenly... nothing, shit happens..They said your fingers become numb, and then you forget everything was there, so the only thing you got to be... Nothing. Just like the rest of

[ WP ] Every single day the world votes to kill off one person . Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed . <endprompts> **Day 1** <newline> `` What kind of hell could happen when everyone votes a total asshole every day '' He thought whilst staring over at his work. As his fingers danced on the keyboard, the whole universe just turned. Not just him but the rest of the humans around him. His mind was racing at work day by day... This doesn't seem to affect him though and his wife and daughter. Why? They are a bit boring like me. Sure our families may come from different religious traditions however the day I went from my home town a big congregation gathered up the masses in my town at the corner of 3rd Street just to see if I had the answers to any more god issues. `` Fuck! Fuck Fuck FUCK THIS HAS TO STOP IT all I can't wait forever.. Maybe I could get some answers with someone else though? Sure not everyone believes God '' `` Yeah, I knew they would listen to me '' He looked around and saw a sign hanging on every building. On top were `` Yes God ''s as he counted out the sign for himself : 1 1 1. One hundred and four thousand souls. He took another step to the building where a man sat with his neck bowed staring into his computer window. He slowly crossed over one thousand meters in the air before the other man appeared. As the door opened to let the world out into his view the man held the mouse cursor a bit longer before releasing it before he pressed the enter button again... `` Fuck Fuck Fuck fuck fuck '' he typed before pressing the enter command which brought us closer to the end.

Just before the moment of truth , another student in his class opens fire on his class mates . What does he do next ? <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered that. Of course he did. They all do - just from the looks at the scene. She did not react at all, but his hands began to shake. Just that slight quiver in his shoulders, as if they were on autopilot, as if it were his duty. There is no point in trying this any other way but this. He needed to do it. He needed it to end this way - to know how. How the hell to, she thought, pull this off if someone got to hurt her without consequence? She pulled the trigger. And then. Her brains began to explode. They went straight to the amygdala in the brains, exploding like the brains inside of him. His muscles tightened up, and when he did stand upright... Nothing. He 'd be dead of his wounds now, surrounded as a monster. <newline> <newline> The girl watched as a cloud, orange as ash rose in its absence into the still, still air of campus, filled her lungs just after what he imagined it to be over, but she was now screaming, hysterical screams on a much larger, violent landscape - in a forest. No sooner now had she stood there than she felt his arms grasp in desperation again, and lifted into hers in a vice-choke and release a horrible torrent of energy and poison which almost completely fried every cell of the young girl's body. In seconds he died at that rate, every living thing dead before his blood could pump. His heart was at breaking point already. She watched. He died for the world. <newline> <newline> -- -
