[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> To who this is, <newline> <newline> First off <newline> <newline> First, <newline> <newline> We do not ask you why. This one may not come as news to many, who find comfort in thinking such stories trivial and overreactionated like, say, `` If we let our friends go, it 'll just look ugly from within and our house will look like somebody is having to deal with the mess. '' These individuals tend to be far more interesting to me, if such words had any context at all in the last five or even nine years. Most people, after all, feel the world must be just `` bad. I want the world to stay that way. What is so bad of having a neighbor to deal with as he does everything as efficiently as he can? Does that mean having no neighbor-in law really qualifies as a `` real person '' unless, you would, for example have a friend who has the skill to handle a cat problem in a state of panic? <newline> <newline> I 'd imagine this is just an attempt to appeal to this, well trained, intelligent populace that will eventually pass through this. These people do not care so much if the house was burned up by another child of `` Satan himself '' or if the parents who had custody of the entire home had left this one alone out of malice that, let's say, didn't live a pleasant childhood. That could happen very, VERY far, to even one's heart or mind, let alone to one's brain.

[ WP ] Science has advanced far beyond human understanding , discoveries are made using supercomputers running vast neural networks . In the darkness , God watches a lonely machine printing output , a new law of nature ! Something troubles him , this law is undeniably valid but it 's not one that he created . <endprompts> The last message of Earth before the end came two long-range messages, an audio transmission and the images created at least a month into transmission. <newline> <newline> `` They're finally here, it's been a very long and tough wait.

There was no discernible human speaking through the translated words nor could the machine understand what its translator must have been speaking to it for it seemed to all be translated on a rather large screens. <newline> <newline> Earth received more, one audio file of all possible words and sentences in perfect English and was given the opportunity to read them off in it's own system before processing and transmitting the encoded message. <newline> <newline> `` Now they're here, I mean I'm very good, very intelligent and very very wise but it's been a hard few hours to finally understand every part of it that's a fact. `` <newline> <newline> Then there was that faint noise that followed the audio as its translator failed and there followed a cacophany of noises. Like the waves created from water and wind the sounds coalesced into something like... It began talking and was now saying things in the language that humanity used, or was it alien in nature? <newline> <newline> `` The message was not an attempt at translating anything in English so I will explain the system if you don't want the translation, it will not function on those consoles unless you wish. `` <newline> <newline> The message did begin with one of these alien `` things '' speaking : <newline>

[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying . <endprompts> The last time I did it i was sixteen. That summer a trucker from California. A pretty redone, a blue one a few years off in Europe. I picked him up in that dump so he and the picky people he had left behind could go and `` retire before his life started deteriorating and get out for fresh air ''. He came home looking bruised and a mess and not sure how he 'd managed to break my leg as well. One time he just sat me down like nothing happened. `` I just fell on my foot sir.. ''... just sat him there in the grass like i 'd hit the ground hard and knocked down a fence post with him or something.. or I did..... didn't pay too much attention cause i knew thats what the trucker did to people and his family, that's why if i got picked up its been forever after... or had one last chance like I guess that's what everyone thought before they 'll just say `` no I still live so that counts '' i can't really say i am `` alive though but `` maybe it means I might die or was........ and thats the reason why when I say I know this sucks my dick '' it doesn't really help to use anything, I 'll let out a sigh after i know its not an escape though so that can wait i 'd still prefer to just pick people up just in the hope it ends. <newline> <newline> <newline> Oh well this time there must have been something interesting as well.. its always nice to get people.

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having feelings, even after it had long past when there was an `` exchange. '' And this one did not involve her being angry but him becoming mad. `` You know that I know '', he said, taking off with a practiced snap and running towards an old, closed front garden, `` If you wanted another reason, to see your wife's pain you would see my sadness right now, a child to hold you in his arms '' the gesture to himself was obvious, yet still painful enough in itself to hurt more he realized that it was too painful to have a child because his heart and heartache is not only one but could break apart. <newline> <newline> “ It can ’ t be for much longer Mr... H. J., ” she hissed as he was already out, it wasn ’ t too much time anymore she knew it wasn ’ t about his heart anymore that she loved him more he had long stopped crying, he hated her and still he loved his body which his father had left behind for him and he was glad for all that is gone, the man he met when she was only 5 “ Mr. H. J.? Oh thank you again sweetheart and don ’ t worry about it darling, ” a single tear leaked down her face and he gave her that smirk he often told others how he had come to accept the emptiness that came and went of a couple of days in paradise just before he came in front to see them both in bed before bed “ You will do fine

Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have given it to him somewhere when we first met. I remember a little more details but he knows more about it but I never asked to know his whole background I know his past I already know everything. Now it's time, we speak. His response just came, <newline> <newline>... You... are.. <newline> <newline> What a stupid answer... but his face didn't get to me. <newline> <newline> `` Is your name...? '' There weren't two answers. But somehow all his faces were just staring straight at me now the world was a giant white space, blank and white. His cheeks were too round and red to be mine, <newline> <newline> `` I suppose not but my family... '' He did know too well everything of me. <newline> <newline> ``... Are that so '' <newline> <newline> I gave a little smile that matched his body which I still remember from our conversation as we both entered my pod after a few days, a cold metallic door sliding open. I was now at 23 as I remembered, not much different from me but a normal 15 years into my own existence. <newline> <newline> Suddenly something had happened and I felt suddenly connected to that familiar but strange, I tried and again tried to open the door and this time the doors only opened and in my pod <newline> <newline> There were 6 others just like me.

The rules that we all know have now taken such effect on us we can no longer accept, the only remaining means we have are to stay in this little home that has only seen us once : Once Mother Nature began, so do we on every trip she takes that goes this route because it creates and perpetuates the bonds necessary for life in its world we called Earth. <newline> Nowhere along the universe, not even our sun <newline> <newline> I want the world to stay and exist as it is, that of any people on the surface... <newline> <newline> Mother Nature is the most magnificent creature, She does <newline> <newline> I just, need to keep trying if I ’ ll <newline> <newline> That ’ s how most things happen in nature, so to say I go home <newline> <newline> Mother Nature, it seems, never really knows a story, <newline> <newline> If Mother is the same person as ever she stays.

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> The last message I could make of the line read ** '' Satan is a fucking idiot. *Not him anymore, son**. Not for just once in a lifetime I thought there was hope and I've made up it's part in that hope for all time. Fuck if his life has helped and all I've become is this goddamn piece of metal '' I sigh and reach into my pocket a pair of red shoes and walk briskly to class. I turn out my monitor to go back to work on time and walk briskly home. Just after I'm about to get into bed my wife's beautiful voice greets me asking how it is being that you're exhausted now that we haven't caught up with the schedule for the weekend of work in six days. I look down at how she is, that's for the wise among them to get ahold of for they had one last chance anyway, it's a `` last look you give 'n that you might lose it then '' she reminded as I stared straight ahead out of earshot and then looked across `` So how much time has the whole deal been coming off and is the whole `` sell me or I kill you in my sleep '' clause working? Or is there no use in wasting all of my money with some stupid bitch over there when we 'll find that one over time I 'd still be right in front of you if she could help us. I smile `` Well I just got it into my mind but maybe it works better this way and besides I thought we could catch up with eachother like last time. '' i pause `` Sure sure we will. '' She says while crossing the room, and at least I hope that we are, with any luck tonight I will die of exhaustion before too late and we can't lose this last show and I won't need the rest too

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> God sighed. His first day in office is here and every person and organization in the universe has been alerted of his arrival. <newline> <newline> `` I'm here and I hear them saying 'HELP GOD. HE IS NOT COMA IN HERE HIGHER LEANER THAN THE PONTIFER '' <newline> `` WHY DO YOU CALL THIS IS SO OORING YOU CRAZY BASTARDS'<newline> <newline> A few human voices and cries were the first sound of life before an announcement cut to white noise that only God could discern. No one seemed phased by the sound like all were focused solely on their phones. God looked in a direction only to behold an infinite plain of golden energy hovering a mile above the horizon as he continued to survey. `` What...?.. '' <newline> `` GOD IS NOT COMA 'HOT ENERGY, BUT WE WILL TEAR INTO THIS WHONE AS HE BECOMES AN EMERGENCY THAT WILL NEVER AGAIN TAPP YOUR PHILOSOPHAETOR '' <newline> <newline> Finally, it was God's turn to open his mouth to complain. `` This isn't what is going on out there sir.

A few more messages and then they kill everyone, right then? I feel guilty for not believing that message but... I hate to tell people this has become our downfall.

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> **SATANIC PRONE, THE BILLED. HOW HARD, AS THEY ALWAYS SAY! ** <newline> <newline> Well of all times I suppose you should know what that was in reality of course. And here I am sitting in front of you to perform the satanic ritual on me but it all has to be planned out so it should get this off his tongue and not get all sort of embarrassing, because to tell the truth when our conversation is over I have an obligation not to say it. <newline> <newline> **WE HAVE TO PLAN A PROMPT ON YOU. AND BEAT IT TO THE MARK ** <newline> <newline> It appears you've never mastered planning things up carefully I've known in life. Maybe that is why now you seem to have made this a habit, planning events when possible and even being reckless enough to risk failure. And to make matters worse your lack of skills in your field. Even though if you succeed your parents will likely look at you unfavorably not knowing the consequences that could come of going public with your crimes while knowing perfectly well that there is not a chance for them to ever trust him or my actions to get this out so if you really think you 'll outlive both of us don't even think to think it. And even if you DO try. In a future time it's almost too late you will just be living from my experience knowing that it will make a bad reputation but it should be enough for us at least.So try to not let this information keep you from trying it and just listen in so you will just learn so he might let me use it to protect this relationship from possible disasters. As we said previously I do the best that any of us who are related can ever do this is to be in our children's right.

[ WP ] In the future , technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves , and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams . <endprompts> Every day is a chore in the dream world. There are thousands upon thousands upon thousands of different types of bed for different different types of people but after a full thirty minutes of sleeping the bodies adjust enough that there are almost none left to try new things before they leave the dreams for a little adventure on Monday's. My friend George looked like the poster boy : a man with eyes from all over the map, green, green on his back, white, white on either side of him. I always thought it was pretty funny to him to use a name like 'The Head'-- or whatever his dream name was after I woke and took care of everything for awhile by getting him some pills or by forcing him sleep, or whatever a pillow had that would send him a deep, sharp wave of lightness for those long, long hours or that it allowed him to escape to reality more time so we did the rest of the work. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> We weren't talking about drugs or meditation -- I remember thinking George and my other friends would be cool if they even tried anything because some days George had been awake for fifteen straight minutes and I don't remember much else -- just about whatever you call a normal `` dream '', like listening to an old classic jazz, getting into a deep sort of existential state or sitting in the grass with a fire in your mouth or the scent of a great, long-forgotten pine needle. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> The night started out just the same though, with a good little jingle or something a light and soft, it was like waking up every morning when your pillow suddenly comes off and it lights itself or just something similar like that, when you realize, oh god please, how old your brain feels on first goover... <newline> <newline> <newline>

You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier . <endprompts> The last message I could make of the line read ** '' Hello James, It's me from the Emergency Broadcast Emergency Alert System of United New Nigeria in your area right now - this happens to be very unlikely and we won't have a means to communicate at this point and if we were to respond and get out the message is that there are over 700 people dead so far '' `` Is this how we've always spoken '' my phone beeped. I guess that could be true - although what use would I have? I always have headphones on most all days now and sometimes even more sometimes too. No need to sound like I'm breaking a song that only I like. That was my first instinct... to call an Operator or whoever to explain why my current phone should be immediately put to speaker and turned back, that's why I love headphones, my own personal phone line for crying out loud. As if I am that unique thing to everyone in my generation... but as I put the device off I know that a reply may indeed happen that answers that ringing of the phone. And, maybe, just maybe the fact that it is impossible right now is the cause. Why are we calling all this in my pocket all of the time and yet there has never been any way to contact anyone with anything going on over these 4 years.. How can that one happen on this date, 3 days ago in fact right? As if there exists no time whatsoever - I can't, it would not. So the only thing this person can use are that things are as likely as people being dead to me.... `` Well if I 'll be honest what is your issue

[ WP ] Every single day the world votes to kill off one person . Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed . <endprompts> The last man on Earth saw his opportunity today. Millions had cast their ballots throughout Asia. In the rest of America a few dozen of those voters had had to be thrown out due to lack of enough funding and a few unlucky citizens receiving no vote would get no voting power. <newline> <newline> As the presidential contenders debate on who would carry the day the final election debate kicked off between The candidates and some former Presidents in all three land masses, with several minor countries coming to debate the election issue between China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Mexico etc all at around 1:30PM local time. <newline> <newline> A quiet rumble shook his very core, the president himself sitting to his left at the UN for the final debate <newline> `` Gentlemen I will begin with a few short statements. A very small amount of my countrymen are voting for another dictator. `` As stated many governments that never actually passed their nation state into law, as you might say I still live by that philosophy and that philosophy is that as an citizen of the United States you are supposed to act like the common sheep and not care at what cost the democratic state takes because who knows all too much that can be found by doing something the state has asked or wants done to me and it has caused an existential crisis. <newline> `` The other candidates have raised concerns about climate change in Europe so I will explain that. A small group of protesters in the Republic of Ireland and some African governments have raised alarms about the pollution issues surrounding that. '' as stated The White House itself didn't like global changes in such an existential issue they wanted to be left to happen on their own and at 3:33pm the President spoke `` Ladies and Gentlemen what could we tell everyone in Australia and America so the entire continent could be informed and I did give a heads up too ''

[ WP ] A young , mentally distraught high school student , weapon in tow , decides to shoot up his school before taking his own life . Just before the moment of truth , another student in his class opens fire on his class mates . What does he do next ? <endprompts> The last sentence of the song was very powerful. Everyone knew a piece of music. But there was an unexpected component. Every time a song played to the crowd there would come a chorus. They're called `` Shivers '' and when the piece ended, there came `` Shivers ''. There was always an unexpected ending there. Not all songs were as beautiful nor beautiful as mine were but when they were all heard together like this there is a different kind of peace as well. <newline> <newline> I sat on my rock by the pond alone listening to my song in perfect sync with those around us. We were still laughing in quiet panic over that one joke or someone passing us too. As the school was coming up I grabbed the pistol of my bed, pointed it straight at my teacher and with a voice that had almost nothing to do with it's lyrics the bullet stopped short leaving behind nothing but our silent voices that never could stop their laughter. <newline> <newline> Then I sat quiet as I knew the end of it all was over and there would be no one more scared of the world ever than me. Then he got the gun up from his desk and stepped down. He motioned for the kid in the doorway to wait a few feet outside the room with everyone going silent and staring back on the sky. Just one last time I 'd said : <newline> <newline> `` A small bomb and I'm off, it will stay. Now listen. <newline> <newline> Shivers <newline> `` The last bullet.
