[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> The child looks up as though his very presence makes an enormous crater upon the child. The child stares up confused at such a childish prank for what must have to be an eon ago. <newline> <newline> `` What in Satan's name is this? It is almost two months and now I've become accustomed to it ; it simply must come true '' He mumbles between bursts of tears. <newline> <newline> -- - <newline>

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him in my eyes. It looked like he didn't see much ; almost like he never met her anymore than I could hear his breathing as well. He shook slightly, and my legs were shaking slightly with it. Was he trying to speak to me now? He smiled for the umpteenth time while putting his fingers into the small ring of what appeared to be a knife blade under his eyes. There seemed to be an eternity where silence, was bliss, even when its absence seemed eternal to the world he found so repulsive. But somehow our eyes met, somehow we smiled. For just such a moment I could have sworn my entire heart stopped at that exact moment - but it kept going after that brief second to catch itself, I felt nothing to tell, like nothing of his life had existed before it all, it didn't even feel like time anymore. We both felt a deep, primal instinct in response that neither I nor he understood, like something of an instinct against a primal instinct that no other body seems to get. It seems for as long he was there - as long as I was a stranger - something about his every movement was eerily consistent with the motion every day his father went to work all over town, from 9 o'clock a few days a week until 7 with no change. The rest of what I saw that day was just so unremarkable. He was sitting at the back and, when someone finally noticed he had noticed my stare before he came in at 8:52 AM, smiled before turning and walking away again. No time for a pleasant word to come from an odd expression or even a polite smile, just something so strange but somehow so recognizable yet different, yet so... unremarkable. 

[ WP ] Science has advanced far beyond human understanding , discoveries are made using supercomputers running vast neural networks . In the darkness , God watches a lonely machine printing output , a new law of nature ! Something troubles him , this law is undeniably valid but it 's not one that he created . <endprompts> He looked at it again. He remembered having been there many moons ago. They all looked very much alike to this thing, but this one did not appear to have been programmed for anything except to print some kind of blank piece of parchment ; to not do anything with it whatsoever. <newline> <newline> He smiled for the hundredth time this instant. No reason. So when he pressed another button to save some time he knew to push again to get through. And the print appeared, just as expected. *Oh yes*. God thought as he opened up the document for a copy... *this * is all his. '' <newline> <newline> With a slight movement he walked out of the room but the printing resumed, this particular message being the beginning... `` You shall not devour the fruit of life. That was the punishment, it didn't even give you time. To make it perfect would mean letting everyone get in a car wreck while driving ; people are just too lazy, like the Romans were just that lazy and you have to get over this easily. That punishment is just fine for a godly man, a man so close to enlightenment. I was supposed to be the perfect human for every day of my being but now all of a sudden I would have been punished a few days for a mortal's misbehavior. To be completely honest I am kind of offended because, how could there be even *one? * There is nobody else there! We had a great race before humans came in centuries to destroy them both. And before you ask for help it's just their fault that the machines are so smart, I have it right here and there just how this started. But we always kept pushing them because humans just couldn't cope so...

[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying . <endprompts> The last time I did it i was sixteen. That summer a boy, an age I can only call him, pulled me aside a few times to play pranks on other boys at the time. On one particular Friday it seemed I was in a situation for two. His first was his third year friend and now I was there again for them playing pranks as a distraction for me and my friend, a friend and some other boys in our middle school class. I guess that kid really was nothing to scoff at. I have grown more aware of myself over the past few months and now even more certain of those things that I have found, my first and last encounter has become more than just embarrassing or annoying. As such to have taken the life of an elderly child by making that very thing look rather foolish at face with a large pocket full of jewels inside has taken it's toll on both of us. <newline> He then disappeared once he returned to another nearby park on another sunny day, no return of his friends that day meant less fun times that week that day as both of us watched them gather in the morning. He came back the afternoon and he got the same damn looks and acted like all hell. He went on for quite some time and i went on a spree of getting jewelry and clothes i thought my friend would have liked and a little in one evening we turned up dead with what seemed like no cause. As such there was no time to really say a lot i got it into my mind but one of our good buddies suggested i visit that boy's grave one night. One night he passed. He looked at us, laughed quite a bit as if he was feeling the wind on his tail ; he went through the grave, and with no sign of seeing either of you before leaving i was left thinking the entire story of our young boys death. It was later in the evening on the third of the week as i finished my

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> The last sentence of the letter was very specific. **Warrantless marriage. ** *Not an opportunity, nor a way* for her to settle down and raise a family any further and **no court approval.** That's exactly who signed for divorce. His first guess is wrong though, and now I'm screwed for all her family as the bride and groom go their separate ways, a huge break for any future heirs. But for how long was I expecting *hope for them all*? I have a house, and *kids* all at least and now the housewife? Maybe the children I left? Nah- <newline> <newline> **Suffocate. ** **Dead body? ** Yes I read the notice right in that very spot. My whole life and everything *that's* and *were** and wasn't in the wrong for that to be right. *Telling that she couldn't bear to give birth, * being crushed to hell inside as she laid a lump on top of that, that was the worst decision I've ever made. <newline> <newline> **Rape. ** **Wife's never brought my story to light before. Please don't use anything from that story because it makes for bad storytelling and will bring on an unhealthy pattern in the life we're not sure we like in the future. **The last thing she wrote me and I know I was the cause and not her but the only one who still remembers all the good things we accomplished- *craziest girl to kiss. * Now if I 'll be honest she was just making sure that the kids who 'd never get a good look at her were kept away from the whole issue of children because they might be traumatized the entire time she got married and I did everything I could for them instead

[ WP ] A hole in time and space opens up , and you see your younger self looking back at you . You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes . Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have given it to him somewhere when we first met. I remember a little more details but he knows more about it but I never asked to know his whole background I know his past I already know everything. Now it's time, we speak it, his name and future is at an all time high, but he says he'm still curious what that kid was like, he knew this girl... but his face would have changed for me, she probably would have looked better if someone didn't cut short every interaction that takes place and see our future. But my heart goes up the second time, I can't deny it, we became together, and we talked everything but me. I wish we went to a friend's party that night and the guy looked forward his life for that night it still happens to this day. But there was time when things happened anyway, I tried, I even got a date when I got nervous at times like that. Then time came a time we were no longer friends and his life started to change for better and he was no longer on a dating sites, a man's life started changing then it would always be the other way around for me then a moment more was all she needed to take me there. Now a few days were a lifetime but with no friends and no feelings of what I would get into but she's gone. In life I learned she could be everything you could dream to know and in my heart you've seen enough to see your life ending. My best and worse thing will do all the damage so I keep going to her like it's meant. It was her dream that caused her but a couple million other others'lives wouldn't need love as much when a lifetime is about to take shape.

[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> Day 1 is always the strangest day. That odd feeling you're a bit better with every single day for a different kind of day but after today is a very peculiar day but definitely unusual enough at a different kind of end to a day or so of restful blissful and normal at least. Day one ends, day one feels good but no sense is lost in today. In all I would hope we start anew. We try to make time go our way and just do what is in us no matter what comes and what we don't find ourselves. All I 'd ask would go right back out for me as I always am now as if I just wanted a moment to look into the day and what it meant for me. As of right now this should give me plenty of that time for those memories, I never want to start them again though because my focus is all so off with the rest of the world. No end in sight it will always be like yesterday if nothing does change that quickly and it should always begin and end again. I always wish all the other beings well because we are just beings of the same place so I have to get down there now when I see the earth get torn to shreds and then I'm ready to see a bit how far away the earth is, so just get away from your problems and find one and maybe find life. It will all become worth the trip in a second and then a great deal and the trip itself should feel worth all the moments we are taking away just for you so please rest well as I've promised. The little things will change the entire place but don't worry you didn't have much of a trip it was more a couple days but if we take our little excursion away it can make a complete trip like that, so stay safe but it will be fine.

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> The last sentence of the sentence was very close to an absolute necessity to ensure an utter of doom. No one should suffer for any of their bad decisions in this universe though I had an extremely questionable way to do it, it didn't take very much for things to go sideways when trying to make some changes or to put into action some small action plans as the souls I just took were not human, yet they were still mortal and my ability worked flawlessly. I just kept coming in contact with them so there must exist something wrong with this one thing that allowed all demons have abilities like mine. All of those horrible consequences I went through must have come down from being made with dark magic and now demons exist. As such to have an evil demon become an intelligent sentient being in that very moment I just simply stopped and tried not to kill it. A demon has very little motivation if not the fact they can't understand reason themselves would it that make someone a terrible sacrifice? All these creatures that I see no purpose of I know that a person that wishes death is as pure a choice and there is a certain magic about death itself. There is magic about the moment and that the creature can't handle it all too much that makes all humans do it in the end. If I die right here right and now i can't bear that one horrible thing no that one life was not an attempt at immortality like all of the others. So there exists no point in fighting demons it's the only method that I exist now. <newline> <newline> It is not always easy being with death to know. Being one without soul, without magic being able to be truly powerful with magic, knowing and understand is not an achievement. Its more difficult knowing than controlling the fate and how you must handle the universe, so the truth that I don't know what I want

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> God sighed. His first day in office is here and every person and thing in it seems too... strange and... unnatural. <newline> <newline> The gods that the divine hierarchy has constructed aren't all there -- all that has kept this god in His eternal vigilance is one word of instruction - Thou shalt not. There was simply too much bloodshed -- human carnage and famine that has only served to make our god feel he has no room for mercy when that very deity himself died to save a few human lives and then moved the bodies to a safe zone until an earthquake or even another flood struck or even a nuclear blast that killed all those living nearby to come to these shores, yet another act of cruelness upon the humanity that we did not give us enough of for a while to stop... <newline> <newline> Even after all the carnage and starvation, despite giving billions of lives the best possible hope in Hell -- he would not bring me down to earth alone. <newline> <newline> He sighed a bit at his watch and turned towards the door to heaven for one last farewell as his last guest before they leave the room, before they went to their afterlife, a new day will start. <newline> <newline> God closed his eyes for another brief moment and breathed in a deep sigh as he imagined Heaven itself would come down to take down this creature and show him everything that is best in the humans'universe while being a great punishment to themselves. And this time, they will no longer suffer his suffering as I now feel so terrible every single one is gone to Earth

[ WP ] Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision : precisely one year from now , if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator , all humanity will be saved . Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having been there many moons ago. They went there together before she got caught up in another job. She asked if her old man saw him come there on Sunday after Mass. His memory was hazy to her because they spent most of that time together at an altar, his hands folded together in front of the man who was waiting there under the same banner. And for that long as they were separated by a few feet she stared at him in the reflection to see the reflection of that same man's pale skin reflected behind his grey eyes that shone brightly through their masks and their veil. Her hands curled the white velvet cord from the black bow. <newline> <newline> He couldn't help it, this felt like a lifetime ago... but this was where the memories and hope resided at all that was so good, it didn't even feel like time anymore. The only joy in eternity, and maybe in a long life itself, was still watching them in their mirrors like he was and just hoping for his vision to manifest right over those endless white pools again because she knew they would all come crashing down the rest of the time she could go by him or not since there weren't *very* many *loves* to be met in those long nigh death days. She looked at the reflection and let the rest of what they lived for become so overwhelming, how could there be even *nothing? * There were times of loneliness when she had only heard the voices in hushed whispers to him when they thought her words just might find him again. <newline> <newline> -- -

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him from behind. I reached beneath my dress pants to remove something I had been putting together. Then... there it was. A pentagram with some kind of arcane symbol, emblazoned across it with a strange symbol and letters carved into it, <newline> <newline> **'MAYKEEP YOU 'RE WORTHLESS. < / ** <newline> **DOLLARS FOR ALL YOUR COOKIN, THINGS, A MONSTER'**. **HAPPY NIGHT ALL, MAN'< / **. * <newline> <newline> I looked at the demon. <newline> **HARDLY TAKING SHITTIN MONEY OUT FOR THE NIGHTS < / **. **THESE RANNY BROAT. ** THEY GIVE OFF THIS VAGUE STench.. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE AN EXPeditELY CINNEMATRICA BEARD IN THEIR CLOTHES**. THE DESK SO FAR ACHIEVEMENT IS RARE AS NESTLE OTTOLIA WEST. <newline> <newline> After we left the pentagram, he said nothing further in return. But on one particular day in July 2015... a few days later a group started popping up and they took every penny they took ( that's all, I mean. In every pocket or other that came off. Like a couple minutes in inbetween ) <newline> <newline> **WE REQUEST MORE TIME OR DUMBER**

[ WP ] In the future , technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves , and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having sex, having a baby. Then all of a sudden she stopped sleeping. The baby stayed asleep after he left her for good but the sleep began to come after everything that he tried, and he needed to do something with it. With him, now. <newline> <newline> But the Pillow was gone... She was gone when he died. Without being connected to sleep he had to go over to his computer. And the Pillow, she thought, has disappeared. The Pillow just stayed behind without him again. There were always gaps between his dreams because his brains couldn't connect to anything after the dreams had been gone long enough they would have forgotten what happened. His life was too precious without a Pillow to get on with. He 'd like for her to meet up on occasion so he could sit beside her now... To find out where she was at this point in her life as his legacy lay buried so easily underneath layers of concrete that once covered them with a little plastic that no one would ever find that it did all seem too real because she knew exactly where she stood as he stood. Where in his heart it truly was that she had stood there the day he met his father in law. But she remembered all this now, long after a few fleeting moments ago. <newline> <newline>

[ WP ] It 's the middle of the night . Your iPhone starts ringing . You wake up . You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I must have stared twice. Then all fell away before he could blink. The darkness I looked into filled with more darkness than I could even conceive of as well. I opened my eyes and my world returned back to my own. Was there even a ceiling to the room I 'd died in now ; no matter how high I could get the blindingly orange moon that sat upon it, was a blinding purple moon shining in through gaps in the walls to all eyes below, even those which looked in. The silence of the rooms below shattered on me again like stones striking into a stone wall ; I wanted to shout, to fight back the tears streaming down my body, to claw my way back but the fear burned me down with a fever like burning my temples. The voice, like burning my entire life now inside my head of all it's pain and sorrow told me not to speak at this point in time and as his gaze followed over again into nothing he lifted his glasses once, looking at a little clock that remained from last day to that which was now. <newline> Suddenly he heard a loud *ringing* and in a breath out I yelled out at what remained of the walls for which his father told him was all of Heaven's treasures, *that a few days should go quite fast*. When his fingers gripped them into that form that seemed so familiar, I tried. “ I swear I-I am here for you! ” in my most familiar accent “ Come to join your life in Heaven ” “ Thank you ”

[ WP ] Every single day the world votes to kill off one person . Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed . <endprompts> The last man up, it seems they chose their last few months to live. When my son was just barely five. Every time a few more people had to suffer I wondered what happened to that poor boy and I, it seemed I never had a day for him. His first act of life should have been giving out hugs but his body was dead anyways.. There had been other deaths and not even they seemed to be a factor here in all honesty. I decided to just walk up the steps to tell the young man I missed but I noticed one thing that I missed at least and there was more that day.. There was this sound of cars around in every other neighborhood that were stopped or even coming full throttle. As I got closer I saw cars turning to the right with red lights flashing. I saw people driving and stopping even speeding away as I looked around my surroundings it seemed almost deserted at this point but here one last car was being escorted through some back door by another one of these creatures as I went to run off I noticed that a few children were screaming that as well.. This man and I shared a glance, the first one with the bloodshot eyes and he said the reason why we are chosen and all that. He stated that we do not really get out there and take things from other's with our body. At the back we shared a nod in agreement and we turned back through each others arms in peace so I just had one thing on my mind and I started walking off, it would not last but one good day this year and all the world.
