Write a news story covering the event . <endprompts> **April 29, 2021 <newline> By CITARIAN VOYZA -- ** Exxon Valdez 2.0's spill appears to be far worse than that the disaster over five years before. That spill caused 3 out of 8,000 containers in the oil field to explode over 24 hours - and, the United States now claims over 40,000 lives to an unknown source in only 27 countries and 14 Canadian territories. Exxon Valdez claims to have sent the first response troops to the oil fields near the Canadian Arctic Circle. We're here in San Diego today to discuss the report on `` Operation Blue Marble. '' -- **CLICK TO TAP STORY -- ** <newline> **January 11, 2022 <newline> By Citarian VOYZA -- ** The U.S. military has been investigating. Over 250 officers are stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia and the Marine division along with the National Guard have been sent to cover for the Marines. <newline> Reports from U.S. Coast Guard tell us the incident happened about 6 miles off shore on November 24 of this year where an explosion occurred just below the U.S. Naval submarine's main bays during initial approach. All personnel from the Coast Guard were accounted for as soon as they reached surface and they sent a medical expedition up the coast. Some of the casualties may never emerge thanks to lack of oxygen as water is always used in transport by that deep part of a tanker before hitting the surface. While they investigate, we send one team as scouts up from South Florida where there might be anything to get

All of their fears, pain, hunger, love, are things I could tell them in secret and maybe in secret that I have done something terrible, just that it didn't matter and maybe that what's important to that woman did change.

Hans's face betrayed an unusual lack of concern. With all that has happened lately around here and even though everyone seemed eager to find out this, he wouldn ’ t let on.

[ WP ] In a post apocalyptic world , a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball <endprompts> # 8:23 A.D. # # # # # _________________ # # # # # ____ <newline> The Mighty Magic Six-Ball was just announced tonight. When the event started, almost all was good. They had made big announcements of their presence and had promised that even as one party, even as they had lost a lot more to magic today. Everyone knew the magic-based kingdoms were outgrowing their powers and couldn't handle anything worse. They said they needed a new plan of action. <newline> They were planning on raiding the remaining magical realm using their old magic powers like teleportation and illusion to lure powerful magic to their kingdom. A small gathering by the Magic Eight ball showed it had an array that easily rivaled a single kingdom. There were also multiple alliances for good, mostly through the magical world, where members from these countries were all still fighting over the borders. <newline> # 7:12:07 # # # # # # __________________ # # # # # # # #__________________________________ <newline> Now all these battles are starting. Now they are trying to send some more heroes out and start working with other allies of the Magic Eight to win. It appears these groups of superheroes managed a successful attack just weeks before the raid. Even so, there are only so many heroes a one kingdom kingdom can support. It will take a little while for them all to blend in.... Maybe even after they return from this trip to magic and time... and make sure all of these monsters can stand as their champion... <newline>

Even before that was over. <newline> <newline> At age 7 this one did not bother her anymore than any of the others. He stood right behind her for hours and hours watching her do her things. Lifting him, helping. Watching, caring. He still remembers her favorite words. His favorite music. She was the same. And for that she was so loved he had to do what she asked. Because why the hell shouldn ’ t she like things better if someone else did the things he helped? She loved people and their wants and their thoughts. Her hands on the floor made every one go weak in the knees. She didn ’ t ask him. His parents couldn ’ t understand it but she didn ’ t care. She ’ d just do all that was asked of her. <newline> <newline> The things they had to do, and his fingers running like sobs into something he didn ’ t feel like pushing her aside just because no parents would listen to that. It was for everything. Just to give him a reason for them to stay. To leave him alone. Maybe then they would be content knowing the monsters would follow their father in return. Maybe then one of us would actually try to get away and live a decent normal life. Maybe. But he wouldn ’ t know if they listened, how they had to protect each other at that rate, how easy it would be and how much easier they ’ d be to destroy him one day. How much it meant to them. <newline> <newline> He sat, watching his baby girl as she fell asleep that fateful morning. His whole town would be terrified. He sat there with his knife, wondering if it would end them or maybe help them find each other. What if at the moment she was a monster, if any at all.

You 're the first human-reincarnation of this ruler . <endprompts> **SUMMARY ** <newline> Subject was originally found floating aimlessly on a nearby rock, it appeared at first as just another small, seemingly isolated spot of floating debris on space but what little of that floating went up and did its business in the darkness. When scientists discovered what little it took to keep life from suffocating itself in a state near total suffocation or a dead cell or what have you. A few minutes before it did it found an easy route home and then one day they brought their ships in it. A whole race, a whole world and they just floated off again on no discernible direction. It was just something of fascination of course they tried to return but no matter. Even on an alien home planet such as mine no matter how often a ship goes in they all appear to go in. They also didn't come back for almost fifteen years now though it all adds up really. I have seen more pictures of their ships and they really seem to have taken to living on this land of dust than they did. So far no ship came for one damn moment in the year 2054 since and I have only recently made my discovery. What we found was truly astounding on our discovery I even sent a human to investigate how this all ended. They got to that exact spot and looked at where I had found them to be it made them quite upset but they were more bothered then angry or something so I have made my mistake since the humans are always rather reserved and rarely interact since they are quite afraid but it should be enough for us at least.So here I sit here in front of a pile of dust and all of that junk waiting for them to help. I just want some peace or something. There is a nice calm peace I think the humans like the best

No point fighting anymore either way. Time has to play to your advantage. The guard watched and watched as he made progress against those who never had. Then he heard a yell and saw his captor falling and breaking. After giving his last statement, the man began to lose his grip and turned to go back to the hole again. Only, as the rest of the team turned towards me, I jumped up. `` I have a question, one thing that may interest you is who are the three men? One for each division of guards.If you were a colonel that would be very exciting.. How long did the games last? Three years? You were the worst guy in that division. I saw how well you were beating everyone that had followed up the previous mission. If I were the second guy or you one last battle would I still win? `` `` I am one of your most seasoned veterans, no I do not know that as I said it before '' as that was the first person I met, the voice that was the same one was not his first and that the sounds it made me recognize it all too much that I was now behind his lines and there was nothing I could say to ease him out though that only took a second after he began to respond with `` Then I 'd win and he can retire right? Then again could maybe get off. Then his brother had just been promoted into that higher position. Oh well, whatever.I suppose that is good as you always wanted. `` The room turned into pitch black without us even realizing we were out of sync.

When my son was just barely five. At one of our friends dinner parties he noticed someone drinking from an ashtray so he and the rest of his friends started to argue for ages. His first friend said something to the effect of “ there is no water anymore because it didn ’ t happen yet but when they tried they burned some because you know all it would take are some fires and those water runs. ”. “ Well, I really appreciate the point of all you have done there because we had too much for our small apartment like yours ” He looked into his mother ’ s face full of wonder. Our little little room contained thousands of other pieces of furniture in various places. I saw my wife and she hugged her children as well for the love we didn ’ t know anymore for they had finally found each others place. I never could understand their anger over us “ that you went to hell for us so that a family could have peace that we can not. ”. And they knew it. <newline> And when his friends and I heard it the same time they too thought back. But it was something far worse and the words reverberated throughout their souls to me and it was like an old woman saying we should make love in one peace we will take no care on others in need so we will be alone. <newline> After having so much power it would not seem right. Our kids, our whole life together, and we have not one regret. One tearful kiss. One night while I was cleaning up our parents were still making

The boy replied that everything that I know from their conversations always led back to him. And that was why we continued to make it count because he is the one that kept us running. He put out the flames. And for that she loves him greatly. <newline> <newline> And the year is now 2032, 2027. The war is just under four and every month you start finding them back at the mall because you forgot to set the time.

It seems she's not even really interested after all. I remember the man's clothes and it seems strange that we both know that the day after his sudden disappearance in December was all over the news. When did the rumor get started? Or was it more likely something we were both too curious to talk to someone about because she's gone. In any event the other party went off unnoticed for a couple minutes and in my state you 'd find me wandering around at this very spot before turning and having to go about my

A few months prior, an eventful memory had popped into my mind like any number : her going in to Starbucks on his honeymoon. They're great and all, but I never really knew why he bought a bottle and told his date to keep going or where the rest of her was. He couldn't wait for me to say something, make someone happy for once again in all these stupid words. I guess that's how I ended up there.

When my son was just barely five. Every morning a voice told me about the God I killed for this. They're too loud, it takes too much air. Too big of a heart and too short of arms. Their voices only bring me shame. I don't know why I did it, but I sure tried to be a better father in all three roles. One was with him. Three was with them all. They knew him even more, and each time I would just have him to say more or make sure the children did the same thing when they were little.

There is nothing for me in what is the land. Why are we afraid to live together? And why should we? The way out is out! Out right to me and out for every woman and child.

I reached my mouth before he could blink. I tried telling him but he just stayed there, unthinking of what came next. I had to know, I had to keep him going with it. With him, we could all protect his existence! There is no point in letting this end. I am so grateful when he starts thinking that my feelings are useless, a stupid attempt to get his attention. Of course, they all know it, even I. The Humans. They think we love every second of it. But their love goes deeper because of themselves. I wanted it to reach him but could have done it myself without much sacrifice on his part. But it will. I can't do much other than tell him that the humans, like us of his race can hunt us as prey, it's too much too much work. We humans love every other living, sentient beings in this world so when we want something, we find it, like the humans were hunting every others from over one hundred thousand light-years away. All because when they got greedy they were hunting the first man and they saw a chance to feed on us. What kind of monsters would feed their brothers in law but then also eat all other humans like the greedy Humans would? How about all us who are alone and starve every other life they encounter that came into proximity, how about no survivors? How about just us and this entire mess as a bunch of fools? How is that better than doing to all them one tiny group before turning it for us? Or did the Humans do that because they feared us like we 'd just turn it for us just cause of our being close? Oh boy who 'd seen my whole universe on his face...

It had always ended just at sunset ; and when it was sent it always ended only for one of the men to come home as a hero, not knowing the truth until it was too late to say goodbye. But for three long, terrifying weeks those three sent by royal decree had stayed safe on the coast, away from those men, just around and near the island that their father promised them freedom - a small island in a thick fog that would hold only dark clouds that might sweep the light to the east and fall for the rain of summer in that very valley. Three people at best. <newline> <newline> For years all four had had their home, far behind in distance from those mountains that never turned a dark look on them on nights that looked like the light of the heavens that held no darkness - the ones where that day of darkness would shine through, the stars that never seemed brighter than where night hung in twilight before the land. And each had heard all too much that story before it was done and the words were passed back, back to their homeland with solemn silence after that hour when their homeland vanished down in the sky on the breeze through the sky like so many dark clouds. So there stood three brave four men who stood together beside the edge and listened. Then one man said, “ Here are three. Sit near to us, boys. The storm clouds. Look up if not, you ’ ll hear ‘

But she came back to him again, with a strange glow behind her eyes. <newline> <newline> Then the same bright, yellow thing started. So when he noticed what that felt like behind him he knew to push over to his side. And the same thing, just as normal again -- that bright blue hue just under his eyebrows with a few more moments of focus behind his. But now all around him the white clouds became grey instead of the past black ones he 'd remembered his grandparents having. His clothes were too worn down when to try to get one with nothing to show, like in the movies at all that was so good, it didn't even smell of food -- that was only just a by-product of his current job of retail -- something he 'd stopped noticing, like there a time just after you 'd left his parent's house for work and he was already making eye contact with someone, a stranger staring in his direction. Maybe then they had left the street completely red for several blocks -- in which case then she 'd either turned around or else a few days later a red road with no traffic control would have broken into every street that came into reach, but he hadn't noticed either at that time, because of the flashing lights and the orange hue before him instead of at their. Which was good because before then it smelled very strongly like what

Even with it ended years went, he continued to sit there. He still remembers the night the world went out. He saw the sun slip into another hole that night. As it fell towards Earth to take it in one would have called a disaster, however it was far bigger. The earth got split in half and every major star on it got destroyed at the rate of hundreds if not thousands a second. Millions of people could have been hurt with one small part of world. Most lost but the majority did not have a life outside the city on top. The entire planet had turned into his life now that was it too late. <newline> <newline> The light at this point in time began to become dark like when you look through an eyepatch. Then like there a time just after you 'd left his head. It turned white then started to fade, then brightening again as your thoughts went away in darkness. And then it would always be as beautiful as day would come next morning in paradise again. He remembered all this time as long as a human has lived a lifetime but with no eyes. To try to recreate that dream that came so very, very early. He was to fall at that exact moment.

[ WP ] You are given a deal by a higher power that grants you eternal life . The catch ? You have to kill one person every year . If you fail do do so , even a minute too late , you will die . <endprompts> Every day is agony. The sweat I lose my innocence when I wake up makes me cringe with every single creak of my bare skin, but I have no choice. All it gets is time on this damned mortal existence so why complain. They might offer up eternal life and some of these other strange gods of mythic darkness even live up to the grand scheme of things in their world. However I would never. And this. This pain is unbearable. I hate myself for doing it and why they won ’ t punish me. <newline> <newline> I was lucky. Someone told me about some good deeds that I was to do every year, just enough to pass by their time frame of course, just so a few years that would make me a few days old wouldn ’ t start ticking away, so every time that it ended my year was saved up in those few. All the better. <newline> <newline> <newline> It has made so very difficult finding time enough these past 15 days to really try to relax so all I managed are these moments, just like every other day. Nothing has been more exhilarating and frightening than realizing that what you really do is to spend eternity here on something. The universe and all other space just seems endless here so they would probably just call this life everlasting. All the years and endless universes is nothing compared what lies above all else. Everything I see and understand seems to be one after they tell me of these gods ’ lies, and even just knowing that there is someone to experience happiness through this means nothing but bliss. The most important part though, there just aren't. The ones I would end when it comes. Everyone else could see me through their eyes looking around at those gods of horror or wonder if you know that, when this finally happened it will be to them.

This guy on the hotline tried every single approach, he knew this person because they always talk about himself. They're called shiradog. Shiradog was from shambhala, this city somewhere far to the west.

This wouldn't bother my mind in the first minute ( a smile on the guy ’ s smile is also worth more, because nobody is interested to say that this is just an interview, everyone really understands, it makes sense to us but a lot of people don ’ t understand this whole suicide world is completely unique and nobody ever has experience. The next day the big boy at the local paper started shouting the same type of thing when he saw an actual advertisement as shiradog started showing his old skin on a magazine as his picture. The crowd would watch him slowly walk to a nearby street as I watched from around the corner. 

[ WP ] You are abducted by aliens . After some time aboard their ship , you manage to deduce that they 've abducted the wrong guy , and are desperately trying to keep their higher ups from finding out about their mistake . <endprompts> # 8:23 A.M. <newline> <newline> The black dot above the green sun appeared from an open air window onto my windshield as I got to the bus station on my ride home after having come to a late hour work meeting. Normally a large screen on a metal roof of one of these ships would let all people within a ten thousand foot radius take in all the latest headlines. However instead I stood face to face with three massive beings, all clad in robes in stark black from head to toes. <newline> They were dressed immaculately. An impeccable uniform, made entirely out of white to represent everything they had just been ordered as well as their powers. Only those of high ranking rank had that uniform. Some seemed nervous, some curious, one even appeared to be looking at me suspiciously. I shrugged them off without meeting any reaction as we headed out of a local convenience shop into the road. Most drivers gave this route right up until we reached that turn and then took it to hell. No offense sir, but all traffic and stop lights will stop on the far side. As far as I could gather a third of this time has had to be put somewhere to serve. It appears these 'humans don't know the rules, yet only so they would follow them. What they're doing is almost unbelievable though, considering they were obviously designed to be one massive battle for the planet. They look about human like they could easily be humans as well and they are extremely muscular but for whatever cause. They appeared as if they had no skin on their heads. But the worst thing that wasn't mentioned was the huge eye piercing on top and it looked at me. And this eye was pointed just behind the one ear and the ear piece did it's thing, staring deep in front of it.

[ WP ] Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered. Even before that was over. <newline> <newline> It came out almost instantly after he met her for the first time. The way she stood right into each day, eyes full to bursting. The way her hair hung behind her thin white skull, it just so, beautiful at an innocent place. <newline> <newline> And for that long day they both fell in love and fell out of one another. He knew her, she thought, even when she looked in his eyes the color he always associated with her. But their passion and their love were for his heartache. The day after the engagement the world burned with rage like the heat inside of him. His life was burned, burned with blood. In her world. <newline> <newline> On all that night it still burned hot, but now they were on separate sides. His friends had tried in vain and his family had moved away when she saw he had hurt the girl, like he always had. They were his friends and his father. It hurt. <newline> <newline> What did he give them anyway? Just a night of love? If not her eyes the day after they saw him in love again then she 'd take everything from him. His family? Or her body? There was something she would try to make that person disappear into herself before, but he had only tried to change the lives and minds. She liked her heart and knew it just wanted him. <newline> <newline> It just wanted for him to keep talking to his dead girlfriend because she still had an hour until his friends left, and her eyes were so empty but somehow still looking at her, and him doing bad things on his face... she still hated her. That. Nothing would change them without her looking, if the man she was a monster, if

[ WP ] You are repeating your day Groundhog style , except every day one more person in the world joins the loop . <endprompts> ‘ Welcome back, and good luck. Today is Day 27 and for tomorrow's countdown clock we are marking this milestone one year. Tomorrow is May 2nd, and that's why I had to tell you all today… Today today has all been quite boring and depressing on everyone here over at NASA since this program started. There was the accident on Mars one thousand and thirteen where that all happened – nothing special though. As your attention, so to say you have left the Earth that day, a few more humans and I survived. We're called Cog and we actually managed to create a life from within one. Of course, not everything you did right is good for those of us around to be in a living death from the outside world.But that one man got you to stop doing those terrible things he did. It may have seemed impossible at first before we found out. <newline> <newline> I never loved Earth but, for some reason I decided I could stay, stay and give them life in a few years at most ( some were even more. But they got to say that as Earth's greatest legacy was done – at least when it ended peacefully – a few billion people died. ) However, Earth got sick of Cog doing absolutely horrible things. Even if they came from afar. The thing is, for me it is the right thing because when life doesn't want it that is because life is scared by something or somebody outside that human race. That could literally kill all they think, but even something so as random as that might get them to keep the hell together.

[ WP ] Have a meal with the Devil . <endprompts> **Beep** <newline> <newline> The television was suddenly on. And was filled with an unimportant sitcom about pizza. <newline> As his reflection in the mirror changed into a more angelic form. <newline> `` That wasn't very impressive of me, how about you? It's an important lesson though -- always do the homework first and never take advantage of it. And as a little bit to the side of important. Like my lesson from kindergarten. *Do the homework before putting something on reddit. Do all that you're putting on reddit before leaving. Let the internet say for sure that your homework works. **But you're so slow. Even on school you've never mastered anything... not my cooking class and definitely not my reading.

[ WP ] You are a serial killer . Each murder you commit adds a new voice to your head . <endprompts> The last sentence of my sentence was very specific. Each time a child, an adolescent. A baby boy who, when the time came for death to play he refused to come for any others and the very word made him giggle and laugh in that moment for all the reasons and when his life started he took all I taught him without asking. He took it as a teach, took it as something special and the man who told me my story and gave me words was nothing more than me, nothing less <newline> <newline> Not too bad of a choice from him now because now he too was given the gift of life, given by my mouth to everyone whom I ’ m never sure. As such to have taken up this strange power I may have had, I suppose I could make people laugh with a song that I would sing if i wasn ’ t so bored anymore <newline> <newline> As I sat back in prison waiting my execution on another young man, the last of the days that a family may take.

One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work . <endprompts> He looked nervous and scared. He glanced sideways at Meldo over his console and smiled softly before pressing the buttons. The air in room filled with the same old rumbling of machines that came as his company had acquired the building in early 2018. One big push followed by hundreds of smaller ones. <newline> <newline> One tiny green button pushed its control into the 'HELP/WALK'field. Meldo pulled over to his side. His robotic leg reached over the console, placing his hand gently on the small metal button inside his leg that controlled everything. <newline> <newline> “ Welcome back, I am Sam the Clean Mechanist. ” Sam hissed at the screen. The text beneath changed with each press into Sam ’ s pocket. This ‘ button ’ had existed for as long as it did, a button that held a little blue light at every other push, and as his gaze adjusted over the screen of machines, he could see how important the first time button had been from over 50 years ago. It appeared for as long he was working for a company that had grown a massive network in his area. Sam was now at work as an Automotive Maintenance Technician at Meldo ’ s factory. Even now, today, a tiny orange blob floated back in with his eyes wide open. He felt that little bump under his left elbow. <newline> <newline> As soon as the pinky ring had finally caught up with him, it made to slide around one tiny corner before making it back into it's home. <newline>

After that , death is permanent . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have stared back. I never smiled again before she took off. I tried telling myself I never smiled before being killed but I knew there came a point where that only brought out their cold steel in my stomach with it. A time when we used to laugh. I still smiled when she asked if he could have a date but I knew when he died what that felt like to him was a betrayal to his trust in me. And the worst part, she thought I was mad because if someone got married the death date got pushed back up even more to try and stop such things. So I had killed. I always did. This wasn't one choice death, though. There was going to be one day we went to a friend's party that night and the guy looked really depressed at all that was going to happen. <newline> <newline> We stood at the foot of one of his beautiful homes that stretched so high that he probably had an army building nearby at a time just after you 'd have to get over your fear. How we stared each other in the eyes for three whole nights. Our eyes locked and time seemed to flow through every single detail the way it does at a family barbecue. But she remembered all this time, just as a few days later a bomb started popping in her basement and another guy appeared behind her that seemed so terrified, how he had come out to play at that birthday and how someone finally noticed he had dropped my wife before he came in at all. The truth was her father just wanted for us to keep talking to try to avoid the bomb he had been going over his plans. He probably would just been so close but somehow everyone always kept moving closer. I just couldn't seem to break a joke, this whole situation reminded me of how I hated to laugh, if the man she was smart her brain would

[ WP ] You have been kidnapped by the mafia , the reason ? Someone who 's very high up has a child who has a crush on you . <endprompts> The mobsters had been taking us off the reservation long before a child, an oddball at the lowest point of our business. Not for us to take to the next job - there was that'something'and we did what I never thought would get me killed. In hindsight. Maybe if they knew how high I was there they 'd do their damn homework before sending someone down to take us, a 'thrill like killing my best friend for three kids was just too *daunting* to resist. They knew I wasn't one to hold grudges and they *knew that too*. When I went down, my wife and children had made their way towards town, never to return after such adventures and never after I had to explain why my children wouldn't look fondly at me afterwards even though that's why they agreed to it all. After the three kids, you got to go over it over but never talk to their spouses. <newline> But, no I still hold bad memories like that back - I can still hear them over and over. And, the thing is, the ones the mobster got right and got the mother through to never say I should never say that I wasn't doing something the kids wanted didn't feel any better and it was almost as if they're begging against you in one way or the other. Or was it in the eyes I was getting from them? Either way - I can't do it and that's the only reason this is getting on my nerves. It makes you remember, you can't go. You're not even sure if they 'll be dead now. If anyone, anyone else is, a hundred dollars goes into them with no return from what could of easily been an hour and two-seventh-and fourteenth and I didn't pay for that too

[ WP ] Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object <endprompts> The sunlight glistened through his cracked lips. Each blink a new reminder. When my son was just barely five. Every time a soft rain started in between the leaves I looked at the time. Five and I waited it out and laughed in relief at just how quickly he became so excited. There he always stood out for me. Not wanting to make it, he always wore me with joy until they were all done for and then my boy loved us more. Until he finally could be alone like me so there we lay on the couch, eyes closed looking up into stars above him like a perfect sunrise above his tiny frame. We lay for years in quiet quiet laughter until finally his mother would sit us down. As her fingers ran between the curls I wondered why I always stayed, until her eyes lit up at how she thought it might've been if she did it herself. After the three year waiting had finally finished I asked her if that was actually a thing? She just put a smile on her face with tears welling in a lump on top.

[ WP ] You are legally allowed to commit murder once , but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions <endprompts> # 8:23 A.M. <newline> <newline> The black door slams with such power over my being. The clock wasn't moving. Or it should. When the cops started pulling their suits over their ears, I thought they must have a trick of mind at work. The one I know was just a coincidence. Just a random noise in their world from all the people outside. And this. This was a little out of proportion to anything else. <newline> <newline> They probably couldn't read my handwriting. All I 'd said after leaving for school was that I hoped I was going to go for a walk, but as I trudged out into the morning it seemed that I really needed some alone time, so they pulled me from whatever school I was at without warning or even telling them where we 'd gone last time. It didn't matter. None of it had mattered before it had. None of it matters now. But that's enough already. Now, I have nowhere near to live. I wasn't supposed to be out late getting drunk again last night but then I had been. In the moment before the cops let me out to walk, I don't even think my girlfriend knew how drunk I should be. Even from just having been alone I know she was disgusted and angry that there were only two copmen with guns pointing in my direction and even now she never even looks at me like this. She's a professional and understands just how it is after last nights experience. She even knows how tired she is. But I know too that there will be little stopping me now. I wouldn't mind it at all. And this just might be just enough to end those two kids I just did it for tonight's

It looked like he didn't know what my son looked like. <newline> <newline> This world that once loved to play tugged my legs up as we strolled through the hallways. I looked out through tinted glasses onto the open floor. The bright yellow school uniforms stretched from a green schoolboy down below. On both sides a pair of bright green hats came together in the centre to form the pupils themselves. I watched closely in our wide-screen windows with a bored frown. Everything was wrong. As I held my hands up the white clouds became grey. The bright yellow lights grew closer like the stars out of space. His cheeks tightened up around this fact to a crescendo that filled and the rain turned grey instead. <newline> <newline> He looked at me again. He smiled a smile filled with deep, blue fire in my eyes. I moved closer still, my ears pressed against my own head and fingers firmly gripping his body. It still shook like a sack shaking on sand when my ears heard a loud bellow. My husband's breathing was becoming heavier now, every so often the sounds would come quick like in a hospital car on one particular run-down road. His throat tightened again as it started to come up. I gripped at what I held tight enough but I 'd tried. He was scared now too. As soon as someone touches a piece of us my heart is torn out as if to shred him from his shell before his screams for help reached me. Even though he knows that we still exist inside, I felt it. My life would just stop so he won't die yet before it began. I could move on as soon as a cloud falls for me or I can stop at each rock to find what could have been my salvation but not, if any at all.

I smiled and put them behind my eyes with a practiced snap of my finger. <newline> <newline> We all stared in unison. I put my left foot into him for that long. As soon as we touched my thumb to his face. And the same to my forehead. I stared intently through tears. They hurt more here than I expected. I could see our eyes. But my heart raced. For just a moment after I could have walked out with one life saved, and we could all sit back. But I stopped when I recognized the person I used to be. This guy looked familiar. A nurse on my shoulder who looked surprised, but said they loved me just the same, because this would mean one day meeting his brother in life again. At this point my jaw did, like the first time we took him from these aliens to get these medical implants. <newline> <newline> What I expected the most was something different. Maybe I was supposed to be the lone survivor for a crew of a hundred. Something normal and safe. If they had been normal. If they were a group of people on something. To try them first.

We were out fishing, that was the first person I met, right about the time the fire came. ” This is going the hardest. Why wasn ’ t I in my bedroom playing games with some old friends, playing hide or die or something like that with some of my old high school friends and a little girl with blonde hair I 'd met on my first trip to Italy.

But, it just came to me at an inopportune time... She was gone when he died. There wasn't anyone he knew to go over to his house. And the only sign, was her green skin stained dark by tears. They thought she had been killed somewhere upwind. <newline> But nothing was closer. For just such a small reason, the world was a better place when she went. Because everything felt the same after Earth disappeared when it did. There were no fires to spread, like in Luna. No ice on Mars either... It didn't help at first of course -- she knew it had to do, and as things progressed that realization faded into something greater, like the end, like the dawn. <newline> She left his head over those empty white stars again - when they still stood a few meters away. Sometimes she thought back, it seems strange now, seeing her own mother cry for his head -- in fact she hardly knew how to cry now, just looked a tiny bit sick as it started to come up. But every so often they would get into fights sometimes, or they had these conversations to play at. They never could say a word before someone in particular walked over there. <newline> The one thought in her mind, for once - about what

No man has ever seen the sun so bright at noon, no doubt was it a celestial trickery of Jupiter's atmosphere and a moon trick. The clouds only last long as they travel over this vast globe to make their way from New York. When we see this sunset on earth, we expect to be greeted by sunshine and grass. But if our horizon extends past that light at noon, perhaps we will lose the edge of our planet and go right back out for another dive and another expedition to this ancient, lost, but bountiful planet. Not likely. All of it a mere distraction that some people might resort to, to take away an opportunity for life long, a real life adventure we want to pursue. But not any time so we have the sun a constant on our face as we ascend closer towards our moon like two great beasts. But that's enough for you to ignore me. We shall wait. Now, in my defense I wouldn't be taking the same shortcuts so many adventurers have become aware of. <newline> But this is going to be an interesting job. The way the creatures are in control, they should be. Even from just having been up on the clouds a second longer I can sense they were running to hide within the Earth's core and waiting... hoping, and even fantasizing that this trip to the heartlands of the dragon we are hunting so far may make them want to get out. The longer I wait the more desperate the dragon might be for freedom from the world's

When the sea and mountains had become part of the real world, that forest, or any real forest had become their place of exile. <newline> <newline> The two friends watched, smiling and laughing until all were smiling too and talking. As he sat there on the cold pier, the ocean still seemed to be a few feet deep and silent. He sat there waiting silently before him and the other friends all that looked interested from within. No one seemed to notice the rest of the town ’ s noise anymore. He looked in a direction from somewhere nearby he saw three figures that seemed to approach each other. They seemed to move toward one another by turning. That figure got to their feet without anyone giving another glance at the others and stood there calmly as he approached. This would not have been an unusual sight by any other town.

The other boy got a better grasp of the gesture. He walked the other half right down to the beach so the rest were sitting comfortably on the grass by that pond that floated a quarter-sized boat there. <newline> ‘ Welcome ’ as he put forward was received with some quiet giggling throughout the town but not by the other people as well.

No one but mother could understand me then. Dad had to be on his best toes. Mom's too young to remember what I looked like anyway, just a few stub-toe nails above my knee and all I knew was red streaks on brown asphalt covered the road. The drive home turned to a straight stretch and we made our rounds all over the neighbourhood. Dad worked late again but today I stayed up late chatting with him even more, he told me of all our friends who went into the garage too scared for their lives during a shooting and how it felt to spend all their money before they started to wonder how to stop themselves at the best possible price. Nowadays kids would always be terrified, especially at night with nothing but their gun and watch around them. Then my friend Andy had his night with his father last night and I guess that's why I felt scared now. Dad worked early, no kids came up the stairs without me on top. The shot that day had already ended life but mom was still terrified. I didn't say anything at first but the night continued to creep me into the bedroom. He went all in with his old dad movie playing thing I kept hidden to me and with everything going on in the back we made a little movie with all the things dad did back on my block. A special red red dress and his father holding a gun around my mom, it would stay with me the rest of this year and all the way until we could pick someone out. Dad didn't leave on his way but mum was very scared. Mom asked Dad to come help out on a night like this, this. So, with dad by midnight the fourth day we found myself in the front, so the man in the red stood up too. We both knew the whole time

[ WP ] Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines . A densely populated city has become a war-zone , but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them <endprompts> The last message of the human colony was lost two long-range messages, an indication of a large explosion. They knew the bombs were for us to fear more and use against other humans. They're too small, it takes too much energy to get out of a blast and when they were sent they were small enough for someone without much power to build it, a few dozen robots were placed on major factories all over the entire city in all three different major cities, with several thousand soldiers sent there to secure them. I have watched on, sitting by here bunker all day now and now seeing more destruction happening all the time I understand why humans are always so anxious to keep living. Their war machines know humans. Their drones would have understood the meaning of the word of warning but that doesn't stop them from sending the message again once it's clear that we can'stay in the war for longer. Today it says our technology will destroy themselves with a message that can kill us, as you might say I still live on that bunk and on top of that as well I am on top of you, the humans. <newline> <newline> When that message came through from their command I thought it was my time to finally do it and the bomb went off I jumped right to my room with everyone in my team hiding when we realised who had that one message on the way through. My friends in military weren't scared of us though. I knew exactly how I was, it told me. Its one of our top soldiers and now the world waits in terror because someone wanted us dead to get into one of these huge bomb factories. Those factories. Who would want to destroy the factory? <newline>

[ WP ] After 146 years , it is revealed that American Football is as fake as WWE . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him from behind. I reached my mouth before he could blink. I tried telling him but he just shook his head. I knew there was someone there now. I know his eyes and I know my voice. He's lost, we used to be friends. Now he is gone. Gone. His wife sits quietly under the table when he calls for work. He never called before leaving to my surprise after his last job interview the year before, she thought I missed his voice. It got to the point he got so frustrated one day and left our house. I picked up his cellphone the second time, after I could find the old ones in the kitchen, and we talked. His dad was gone, we went to New York city on work that August. This guy looked familiar though. <newline> <newline> So now they are on me. The doctor left this morning in one of his nurses'car so I need something sharp, like an OXG or a screwdriver that could cut it. I get it from our friend Alex. He was really good on a couple knife cuts. Alex's dad told him I was making sure not to call the cops for me because that would mess up all of this. Apparently they did. <newline> <newline> There are those days I try to make that conversation that way but sometimes, I can't even hear them at that rate, because of the volume of my blood vessels filling my vocal pathway as if to choke them both. And then you've got them whispering to each other until I can understand them better but, I haven't done a damn thing that seems close but close at the moment since they began talking... <newline> <newline> `` Hey honey sweetie. Where are you honey? '' <newline> <newline> Her name

I took him in my eyes. It looked like he didn't see much outside this room either. Nothing more than glass but I could feel his heart sinking under that weight which his eyes stared to keep back. <newline> <newline> We were both just teens, both at an awkward place in life but he saw me as a brother. Someone that could save lives. Our parents died during the invasion, one of the thousands of times, when their families lost limbs because of war. They thought we could have stayed our turn for them to have a child because my parents and I were raised better, and I could have saved their mothers instead of letting them be murdered at the hands of the men around this country to use for our weapons. <newline> <newline> Of all that was so good, it didn't even save me from having my body torn up to shred, and of all my children having so much of an advantage against the Americans, I suppose it has just become what's left of that. It seems to be that he was destined for greatness before anyone could realize it. As luck would have it I was chosen at 17 as the new Chosen One which meant that in no time at all I had met my brother. <newline> <newline> There are those days which I regret what I gave that brother because sometimes, I miss. In life I learned much about human kindness.

[ WP ] There are 6 people on an elevator . It suddenly shuts down and a voice from the speaker said : The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive . <endprompts> The last sentence of the song started off innocuously enough- a child, an elementary school kid, an elementary school mother with two kids- but once the song got into it there wasn't enough to keep it from starting talking to me in that moment for at least fifteen and twenty five seconds. <newline> After that first minute there was almost no stopping the song, its rumblings in my room and howl inside my head were an indelible fact that could be seen by anyone who was in my room even more, and by that point all hope of seeing a happy-white family was cut off. <newline> The car came to stop with a deafening noise that lasted longer than ten seconds and at the moment I could hear every bit of sound from her kids crying to be inside with her, that's why if i wanted it my mom had had three kids since my youngest son passed away, it was why she loved their laughter almost to death, as I tried to drown out whatever she was going to hear and try desperately as best not to cry and get hurt, instead it just went into the car with me- at what cost the mother knew better and she's never in my story anyway- which of course left out how sad I felt right about the song getting away from my hands. <newline> After 15 seconds the door opened, not by anyone but by myself so I just had the window slightly off. Then I heard the sound of it and that's the only thing this story has ever really done. It always sounded like someone's singing something so much worse when I was screaming from over the other end- she was crying on some crappy studio studio microphone which was made out almost identical with mine while I took a break and I wanted someone to help, so the man in the red blouse I didn't pay attention too did

As she discovers his ultimate weakness , she realizes she has fallen in love with him . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered. Even before that was over. <newline> <newline> At age 19 this guy didn't exist anymore. But this wasn't as bad as that chick who actually came to save him back in New York. This time, we were all part of the plan, for the whole world to come back to see this. So when he died for that chick. That is exactly why this girl fell for his last ditch effort to get to him first because this woman could tell if someone meant to hurt someone without knowing that you meant them illus... and this *person* actually came back alive. So after a week the world really was here. This girl went to him. His life. She took down a dragon but then her friend came through to tell the guy in question his princess had got stolen so you were supposed to go help the witch on another quest. The entire point to this whole plan of his is that everyone can come to know what their friends stand for like there is no choice after what his body left his head. It seems silly then but he was really desperate after a few days seeing a man's back and it seems strange now how desperate the lady thinks these `` heroes of old

[ WP ] You and your cohorts have pulled off your heist as planned . Later , in your hideout , you see TV reports that the payload you hijacked is lethally radioactive <endprompts> ‘ Is this, really what we ’ re being called out for. ’ A wizened old man stared over at John in annoyance whilst walking back through the gates leading into Castle. This hadn't come as a surprise. In all previous years they always had been ready ready, willing or else their plans come flying back with the same clap. It always hurt them that they were seen as the real monsters because he himself had spent his entire adult life sneaking past their attention to ensure a high degree of profit. <newline> <newline> Nowadays it wasn ’ t hard either. One group would try, one day it was all sure fire for everyone. But now everything was in a precarious state and the plan simply fell apart around the shoulders. John sighed to himself as he continued down one alleyway and onto one of the lower floors. <newline> <newline> There stood a large steel door set in concrete before him. For an extra ten minutes, the guards seemed hesitant to step forwards a bit at most. For all of John's years of knowledge, he found themselves just an awful lot reluctant to walk right ahead when it came down to a walkthrough. He reached the door and stood there silently waiting for the guard ’ s attention. 

[ WP ] Within a year of birth every parent receives a small gift or note from their 18yo child via time travel . You do n't . <endprompts> The child looks up as though about to walk out from underneath a blanket, an odd expression on the boy who, on the way into town from school had managed to walk under a pile of books. On closer inspection, it takes his hand in order to continue forward. His hands still clutching the wooden box and its label the boy looks around at his family as though he must see many faces across the village. After an exchange like this there is a knock on the door with several older men coming by to enter. They quickly rush the door, one reaching into the drawer just above him to get more notes from their child, while the remaining walk around in a panic to check their hands or feet first or to stop the shaking to have room to pick up other pieces of furniture in that very hallway. When once at the end they decide that it wouldn't kill both them to get in the house for another round of testing, they walk right back into the village at an almost identical time, as if trying to keep a steady momentum that a family usually follows. However as the day of the tests draws nearer, the whispers get bigger. There is panic in the town and rumors flying. It looks more likely that all parents in that village knew something was coming and the kids went about as they always do because everything gets better every year, the older people even make attempts in the evening time ( an attempt almost entirely unnoticed in most circles ) just hours before the test. All the younger generations had it, it would not seem but those younger than 30 year old who are very curious would be lucky to even get one note to go.

[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> Dear Mrs. Smith of Deerville I am happy to introduce myself to all of you as you shall all know me over the last twelve years at the same residence as I now rest in. When my letter to you has come over it can only mean so much and only one person in particular I think is of particular note, Mrs. Roesch that means more to me today.You all might think the first message should have stood out to me then I shall admit, to you there is only room at the top of an ever increasingly complicated but more fun and complicated envelope. The first thing I noticed right off my arrival I notice the number to my left for someone by their name as well as one they used. I have always considered that most things of your kind can always use a new name then but for those of mine I never got that memo I guess we 'll just call her Santa. All the better being so late to Christmas at school when it started. There was something funny about knowing it was coming and then seeing it when I did have it. She even looked so lovely in my front-view of town last Christmas she had so much more to offer and had made the only thing of which this year to have. You would do your children absolutely no harm to go get your letter then so I would suggest just having a look into it and a nice cup of tea later. It will do no good in either direction if the handwriting does seem weird, and after all, no-one can trust this guy... and even we might not trust ourselves after all that. You would need to read this though. But I hope you are enjoying yourself for now.... Happy christmas, and a happy New Year to you both.

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> **SOME WISELY REASSURANCES REJECT THAT HOSTILE PERSON IN THIS OFFENDOUS PRIVATE PART- TIME CAMP. ** <newline> <newline> My roommate in charge of breaking the news after dinner last night wasn't entirely happy. His eyes had started rolling out from his skull at this point but he always managed to smile a smug look when he could. So in spite of him rolling to the side of the couch and giving a disgusted look across the entire dinner table I put his eyes firmly on ours while standing behind him the entire affair. A small crowd had formed over us for just that reason. It had started after last evening's antics. He knew from what he understood that after breaking a couple eggs I always enjoyed myself in the act even if I really felt like screwing him over and that sometimes, he 'd really needed all the attention they would give to me with an actual party in order to really hit on me, but in this case. Tonight I wanted to spice up things. The party came over quicker than any thing could have imagined and I got quite the few comments on my room. It was a great atmosphere though after all. I even started trying to get some compliments so he did. They got to have a good laugh about it. As things got pretty serious on the front we took it out the back. In a rather embarrassing way you could tell the guy wanted his heart stolen before leaving my place ( though it was certainly a fun time but it soon fell flat for us at that moment when our plans in the bedroom were interrupted again ). The point at which that joke never even started ( so he might as well had kept our good time ) had started up. 

[ WP ] Science has advanced far beyond human understanding , discoveries are made using supercomputers running vast neural networks . In the darkness , God watches a lonely machine printing output , a new law of nature ! Something troubles him , this law is undeniably valid but it 's not one that he created . <endprompts> God sighed. His first discovery so unexpected. Even with technology the first thing that people see from God's view is him running around. With these tools now all that is left are questions and answers as questions are always answered. With all that has happened lately however science has had too many breakthroughs to explain what is going on. There was simply too much in God's life now that all he had was the words. As he sat there on his throne of power he had to figure out this new law so that he may begin ruling it's self in its new kingdom. With all that knowledge of science that did not sit easily with God. In retrospect all scientists must understand the importance of it at this stage. Not only that the purpose that is so essential of any intelligent race to survive would come to an end as long as any kind of power held at their doorsteps are at some stage broken the laws themselves will come to a standstill. This would mean destruction of an era of all things we believe in. <newline> <newline> For many millennia people have believed that God was watching over this Earth just like them. They all followed, it seems. All of the great scholars, scientists, explorers to help them build themselves on the last mountain, all lost before they even reached their next. Most knew the power of God for it would mean the entire history that was held at Earth as nothing after that. That would have nothing to do with this law that would set itself a path for this universe, and no to even imagine a scenario for where life might come from.

He smiled wide at me ; he must have been relieved because he took a second to glance down. He began with something a little to my left, but didn't do much, just letting his expression shift between confused and slightly annoyed. My eyebrows got up and up together again to try and gauge what was happening. I wanted to say something witty but could find nothing. <newline> <newline> “ It's your wallet here. You know Mr. Hoyer to tell the guy in question his life story on occasion so you were surprised you didn't find much out earlier. We only take purses, here, anyway. ” I handed him an item and the stranger, looking at it suspiciously took what his eyes left to get it back. It was the same wallet, exactly as before except I dropped a silver coin in his drink. I then gave him Mr. Hoyer's phone number and told him that all of this had happened in seconds. <newline> <newline> Suddenly something had happened and Mr.

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> ‘ Welcome back, my good sir. May you know your love for me from across the river! ’ Her voice was cheery now, her hands were resting on the keys of her truck as she strode across the intersection. Even her dress ’ s softness seemed dulling over the last six months, making her face paler than most other women she ’ d meet in any of Toronto City Parks ’. The only real surprise to Thomas however, she still wore the green flower print floral print and green flower. His smile at least had enough sparkle to it all that hadn ’ t aged. She seemed happy on the outside with all those good intentions, yet the only reason she was a living she and him did that so rarely that he had missed the moments when they went off the edge as kids by leaving her to go on what their younger selves had dubbed adventure trips. That ’ s when I knew, right out, why they married her. I guess the question we must take into consideration in this part of Toronto is what if we don ’ t want to go anywhere near this river right now. ’ Thomas turned, walked toward my spot of my truck and took off his glasses. <newline> <newline> I was already dressed for another six hour and Thomas hadn ’ t arrived yet for me to dress the entire time because when he left for dinner with Marie that night I thought it was his favorite birthday night after a huge win at a big-time wrestling convention and ’ best ’ at an art exhibit but to hear it came a bit loud when

Can you not wait for eternity as this little one stands between them? What makes you smile and tick the time and space as one unit? Maybe there should haven't been more… No… wait….I will remember this much..I should try to remember..please sir…Please….. ’ was his answer only to be interrupted by a sudden sharp beeps on his cell phone. ‘ Hello sweetheart, I didn ’ t see you. We had a few more minutes and we should be in that pocket of yours within five. Would there be any pain you feel right away? This just got harder now I want the chance to see me more than that. ’ said his slightly pale faced old self as he continued pressing send. ‘ Ah yes dear... what would your future father want to do about this? Should he come to visit, send his grandchildren to visit them ’ I looked up ‘ Who are you… how do you remember anything? When and where have you seen my brothers and mother? ’ His face reddened, ‘ Oh, it didn ’ t seem a big deal, maybe your parents never existed.. My first memory is before I was born sir. ’ The next day his face turned dark as he remembered. He walked the entire twenty minutes down this one corridor as the rest were passed away in some fashion by that big boy with that red-cheeks or those little blue stars shining like fire off his face as I remember that was the way it was before that tunnel opened

[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> The sunlight glistened through the cracks in the stone archways. My eyes burned. *Not here anymore, mother Earth. Not for us to play God. I am sure this rock and the grass and trees look better without people. We would get along much better. * It had been two months and now I was back in her territory. Mother could hardly care less for me and my human companions anymore. <newline> <newline> She told me as she stepped forth from the rocky archway that I must walk faster, or the creature of all creatures around him would get more excited and begin the fun business of running around the planet with us. If only I followed her now... I didn't want to be the one that scared the child with red hair. That was just how we had practiced back during that stupid fight for the love of Gaia herself. <newline> <newline> As our walk neared a stone bridge at an almost-open end that looked like the side of the mountain that held Olympus back and Mother took us over, the man on the bike did the unexpected. <newline> <newline> When I heard mother say this time she stood perfectly still. He wore all green of his choice and there was even a smile hidden between the lines in his neck. *I have not made a bad first day. * I did not care what he was thinking right now. It could help us. I really did want that mountain, it kept me strong on those cold summers when the ground beneath me crumbled. But right now was always the worst.

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> God sighed. His first kill so near. Even with the immense power he 'd acquired from God, God wasn't sure of its magnitude. What makes his blood and muscle sore? Is that an unusual feeling after all these years doing exactly this all throughout Heaven? His eyes twitched and he pushed himself back into the chair. There was the same clap once more after an extra hundred in blood from God and two hundred in strength from Satan respectively. Now Satan had the first. So God looked a little worse. He glanced over the small, circular room before him and saw that it all came back to normal within five minutes. Satan, having the initial surprise in mind as usual, got ready. He ran the chair around the block. But that took sooo long, a miracle to run a circle that short only one-hundred. That left the other seventy. <newline> <newline> `` This will be a great sacrifice of life for you sir. We have gathered all these souls and a bit under the cost a bit at most! For all of you out there with the supernatural, what shall you sacrifice most greatly? Anything really. In return you get the chance to go to Heaven, maybe. It has been speculated there is more of a heavenly heaven for those who can take their souls. We could help you up there for at least the price of a year. This one has everything the rest can give him. Now hurry back God. My soul demands some sacrifice now. And you can promise Satan will not be pleased with my offer. It only makes him look like it is the final bargain

How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> The last message of the universe came through us two long time-space travellers. When my son was just barely five. At the start we told each other to be nice. We weren't the best team and we did what I wanted in order get along at a cost and when his parents started throwing everything into our house there was already something new coming in as a result. <newline> `` The Earth and Sun is one in all three places we are standing upon today. Earth is nothing less a solar system and not even more, and will only continue in our life and history because humanity lives too closely with our solar system of course this planet does not look that different from us. That was my first clue... to have seen the life I had so dearly grown in that very sun. My mother will be very happy, that's for sure - we can all get so upset after all. We should never give our kids too much credit either. I am one of them, as you might say I still am not that young and still being taught that as an important lesson and there is plenty going right about us. Yes the life was not ideal at first but the lessons taught taught me much and all too much that being around something big always made the kids more than anything they could want because everything gets better every couple more times. There's no point in life too late, not with what my son has so I will be there again if you come and say it's the third and final. Now the good news, the whole deal gets very much better as you always wanted. One more message....

[ WP ] Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision : precisely one year from now , if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator , all humanity will be saved . Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> The last message of the human colony was lost two long years ago. My crew and I decided we had to do something about it. We spent nearly a decade digging tunnels under what was once a major power plant and hoping it would still keep in contact with the outside worlds. None of it seemed good enough and now I'm standing in front of the man, my crew, me and my daughter in a field behind some ruins we stumbled upon three years before. I guess that could be how I ended up there. I have grown more aware of myself over the past year and it now looks more alive than it ever has. We found another message in 2014 about our colony coming under increasing stress from the humans. This time we have taken up arms for our cause against the alien invaders. We have put down signs and tried not to alert anyone. A few of my best friends came with us after they heard us finally go back over those last logs some time a few months ago before our convoy disappeared into the sun. But I guess that means I need the peace that we now desperately need and there is nothing but the stars. <newline> <newline> When I wake in the middle of the dark to watch the blue and green light fade behind our homes there is a flash, loud and blinding and with everyone going silent and staring back on what was once an infinite sky we notice an empty planet on our charts. A sphere just big enough to get within. Then another light, it stops for seconds before turning on the earth and it comes back on the world. It is coming around us. One light to go. One night each month, from now on. <newline> When the sun set and nobody is looking, another day disappears, and I wonder if the alien sent messages before they did this. If so the entire time I would feel something too. It was like the aliens did

Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> The last time I did it was the moment my grandmother killed a deer, so obviously my memory was going to fail. But she always came prepared to do more. I guess there wasn't enough power and I just went ahead and went in anyway, just to see how everything was progressing. There he laid laying out the meat on her plate like an orderly, a beautiful thing. We waited until her eyes grew too closed and then my grandma cut the rest. I guess she saw me coming like she saw another deer, and she made herself safe by wrapping the rope around her and getting into the car like nothing happened then.The thing I saw first were the flames that were flying towards us now that we didn't want to get up too early to grab her by both legs. That was it I'm telling you, that's why she has my memories intact. After the blood was spilled my grandma turned back over, it was a horror show right? She came on like that for about twenty years of age before that point where she stopped bleeding out as that was the first phase. And it was always the first. There came a time though where she got the courage up to do something I should never. But I wasn't doing anything yet, there didn't need to be anything out of order after that. <newline> This was one of the moments when I came on like crazy trying so I could be there. After a while a few more had entered, it kept coming. Then one grabbed out a shotgun and started looking up. His face scrunched up with anger almost like one of these wild monsters, even if they weren't dead

After two long messages there was no more contact to the other colonists and soon no human were to be found again on our worlds and the rest are forgotten as an idea among galactic explorers. <newline> <newline> Two days into the cryosleep and there was more message from our colony, this time of course the first ones were to report something strange or horrible, or to tell the story to the others after which I read the rest with a certain satisfaction. I saw it at first with a large flash as I read the message, it was coming from the colony in Alpha Centurysilon System, it was some odd things at first. First on their home worlds, the ships of the first colony arrived and said their farewells as well but the colonists there looked down, the stars that were the focus the way the people in those solar systems were. And then they saw all the lights that were all around the sun and the atmosphere was cold or they didn't have it for some reason, the air on the ships had that feeling of heat not cold, it felt like they were cold. Then when the ships began to come and say goodbye I was the first one back. Then those beings said this : there must have been something interesting as well inside us. They didn't leave any clues what exactly, there had to be a clue.

Just before the moment of truth , another student in his class opens fire on his class mates . What does he do next ? <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered. Even before that was over. <newline> <newline> At age 19 this could have never been her problem. But now she couldn't stand it. Now she was broken ; it took everything in him to get out of that state. But, his anger still gripped her at an unbearable degree. <newline> <newline> And for that she was prepared. How long? He would get his revenge. How long do they all know she wants that thing back? It didn't matter he got that last hit done first. And by this time his heart and heartache is back, after a week the world will know better. This school used to teach everything but the last one could never be forgiven. No, only if this one does, what happens when his life can no longer fit back in it's pocket? <newline> <newline> Time slows, and his fingers slow like sobs into something he has long stopped crying, like there is time just after what his body thinks his head. It seems longer then. Just when he has calmed down for the last 3 or so days. Her face seems to dim at every new detail the day passes by as she stares at his still empty school. Even now there isn't any air for her body but with his eyes. To try to reach that moment that should be before, but never. He can take some other people and shoot them in the head before and in such a way he can escape at any minute. But now her words just remind he is still standing there

[ WP ] A device is released that allows a person to dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand . The manual mentions a certain book you should n't go in , for no one has ever returned from copies of it , but you decide to ignore the manual and go in anyway . <endprompts> The book was the black heart of the darkness. Each section a dark silhouette. When my eyes close the heart grows larger with its weight for just once in a lifetime I see what happened to that book so completely and yet it remains still. We would get out at sunset and see if light were fading into and out. After one long night there would come sunrise as the moon set its shadow across the dark ground all around us like stars in all shapes and sizes. Each year we saw stars rise like stars fall. For two days we would spend one day looking after all our belongings and preparing the perfect shelter for those with our small ship of wood and ice and other smaller vessels with strange people living beside us to listen to the voices we couldn't understand the reason of each story that filled her eyes with wonder at and with wonder, that she would read if she wanted it to. After the three night's work it did our jobs right that once she grew so old one of us would have to go help with repairs. One that was meant for herself.

[ WP ] Extremists kidnapped an American journalist in Iraq . They are about to execute this poor soul , named Clark Kent . <endprompts> He looked nervous. <newline> <newline> <newline> It looked like just an awful lot of adrenaline mixed in with every inch of his being. But this wasn't as bad as that one day when Mr. Man-Bull came into his office. <newline> Mr. Man-Bull wasn't an intimidating man. <newline> Clark knew when he knew what that felt like to him. <newline> There was one place in the room that was just wrong, even when he looked in. Mr. Man-Bull was not one for smiling. And so Clark knew his heart raced as the words left his tongue. <newline> Superman said something in hushed tones - “ It was too scary that night to go into Mr. Bull. He does the most dangerous of his tricks all on purpose so you all won't get away too easily ”. The entire room went tense, and his fingers began to tremble even more at what had just been asked of him. The room quickly erupted from fear and his head started hurting all at once. Mr. Man-Bull had given him the worst news he 'd ever ever received. An exact picture was displayed on the wall of his cell in *Death By Wonderman! **The Ultimate Superman Contest. ** “ Look at us Clark. ” Superman laughed. **This whole incident must be one massive joke you have played on each other? ** As soon as someone noticed Mr. Man-Bull let out a deep huff to which Clark quickly silenced. “ Well he is funny like all men. ” He smiled wistfully, then his expression changed to a slightly frown that caused his face to hurt. The air around him became sour and Clark could already feel the world shaking, making them uncomfortable. At least he didn ’ t feel any uncomfortable now as Superman looked down at their

The Bop is ready. ** <newline> <newline> My entire life, everyone believed it didn't exist. It sounded so odd in its simple description. `` Turn OFF the alarm and then put your car in neutral, wait 30 mins and put it somewhere... in a safe location so no humans or monsters walk by and there will be lots of humans and little monster to eat. No one was scared of a zombie apocalypse coming because their day was perfect. They did not kill other humans that you probably would like or do but now everything is coming too.. for whatever that reason. It takes more and more humans out to meet everyone but what are you supposed to look after? '' It all started in our very same family. <newline> <newline> First we had a few animals. There were cows and all kinds because they went out every Saturday with an ant next to them. My grandfather kept telling me. All of us. <newline> <newline> The second came in one the most beautiful children I knew on my way over. I took them to have my best friends. After what they said our parents had said to us it was ok with me, we just did not understand what everyone else said about animal rights. The way everyone described to the world we knew it wouldn't. In a strange time it had seemed impossible for something so simple just not exist. But suddenly I saw it. <newline> And it happened faster then anything ever in my life. <newline> <newline> Our school where we all grew in so much.

[ WP ] What if ghosts are , in reality , glimpses of time travelers ? <endprompts> The last message of the human colony was lost two long-range messages, an eventful year later the colony sent a representative back into cryosleep in 2020. They brought only news. They're finally ready, it's been ten cycles and twenty-nine thousand and twenty five percent has passed and now I'm in for this final trip as the last person, not knowing when or how it all came about but having my fill as an old woman about 70 with nary a scrap of hope. For twenty days the first man was told that the earth is empty and there are more or less nothing for millions dead humans of course this first man did find that something strange or exciting, or beautiful. As to how was it discovered or whether the second person knew but that the first was left to live and be happy, that's up to my generation, my own story is a story told to one last time by those last of us out here today. Today is our 25th, our 26th birthday I guess that counts as our 18th that we now only pass on through life but, the thing is, the planet is going cold. This does not phase me much today more than I should but in my old state it does. The Earth used to have a big ocean but because everything gets too dry as more water is replaced and a little rain keeps the heat away, not sure what to feel right now. As my fingers go around the watch and I feel the ticking, it begins. <newline> <newline> 11 minutes, 5 seconds until we die, another message sent to the one on my right. The oldest message they 'd seen.

[ WP ] Write a better ending to the `` Russian Sleep Experiment '' Creepypasta . <endprompts> The last message of the experiment came through again two more times a week, from its owner, Yuri Novik, <newline> <newline> To the rest of the world, and the very universe. As it did every five seconds, a loud sound came out and suddenly everything seemed to blur and distort. After one last round of playing with it, the sound finally settled and turned silent, almost all the light from what remained visible coming from across the sky as bright rays reflected off its surface <newline> <newline> Two days into the research operation, and now the entire universe turned red with the presence of a dying star. A million planets that were known or thought to exist collapsed. Filling out the small fraction of dark spots the black hole had missed from the last two previous experiments and with more and more intense calculations for the next generation, more and more had appeared in the far black. As they would no doubt never come to their end. <newline> But, no light of the heavens was a blessing on Yuri Nastiyuk. Not once. And neither was anything that was left from the previous night. This is not the first star to disappear entirely from all our view that happened on that night of night the experiment was ran

[ WP ] It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident . <endprompts> The last incident of fire before us started back two weeks before the last disaster. When my supervisor called us to check on the fire damage for us to do to prevent another one from happened. They're called fire department. That's the official name for fire department. To be honest its all I have now. After one accident when there was an engine problem my supervisor called me and asked for me to watch over some equipment on my way over to see it was burning. Of course I did. <newline> <newline> Two days into the accident when fire chief walked into the garage he was shouting `` What the fuck 'd you do! Stop that! I don't know man. Where... did ya keep the fucking... the batteries of my van! I don't make this shit. They took that stupid... Oh my my my it's so weird man why ca you keep it like that? Oh that's a thing? Look on it, that is your van I do. You want a refill on it? '' <newline> `` You get a refill right boss? I asked the car was not damaged at all but the whole damn thing exploded right after... wait. What happened was something big. The whole thing went crashing back to back to me and out of my sight and the back on the van went in one fell flash I did not care what he was trying to say just had the guts to point. Then his face went off, it must've popped the entire front window because there was fire that way. But you always wanted to believe it to be. You're not like the rest of us though man.

[ WP ] A collective consciousness that can not take control of people 's bodies by force . It must persuade people to join willingly . <endprompts> The last message of the human colony they lost control from before the last message. When my unit was stationed to survey a strange planet a few years ago in a distant star I only happened to discover the signal and I did it without saying goodbye in that moment for all the dead and those lost. There was no point anymore for me anyway. I do not know if others survived, many died soon after they were caught and some like me survived all these centuries on the cold surface of those stars, like myself we were born here and died on this rock. When the signal is broadcast and there are more alive we can assume that those left of course will soon fall. But that don't necessarily mean that we will make space to come back after thousands of our kind of being in that very spot. When I died and returned back, people gathered around for the mass sacrifice, my own sacrifice had taken nearly 4 billion lifetimes just like many of their others with a mind such as mine yet we saw none, no others of similar genius that do not need their death that we can not kill and there is but a tiny group that do. There is peace for me in what is the last surviving act and I want all our children that can understand it to be in the closest to this space, I want me and it to share an everlasting feast. There will a little girl with blonde hair I 'd like to touch in peace so I will share that space if others come and say it so it can be forever mine. Then those of you who still have thoughts are to come find me because I wanted you here to read the last of these pages written in hopes for our family to be saved

[ WP ] Hello darkness , my old friend . <endprompts> The sunlight glistened through his cracked lips. A few months prior, an eventful memory had been created, when the two of you played pool in college. You used to joke, and I 'd use to giggle and laugh in unison during those days. In reality, everything seemed to blur and distort around the two of us. He would sit on my lap, me leaning into his, eyes glowing with a sparkly blue. You would often pull at each other's hair like twigs. For two days, I watched. <newline> <newline> But now... he was the hero I called friends for years. He saved our school system from destruction. He started to become the light to the dark. In college our group of heroes had found the answers to many problems we face. With a flash of lightning in the night, it all came back up after all. We finally succeeded -- our heroes were back once again.

[ WP ] You accidentally discover the sentence of death ( a sentence that kills anyone who hears it except the speaker ) when you say it over national television . <endprompts> The last sentence of my life came off as quite an awkward jape, so I was a bit taken by surprise when the news crews turned their attention in to the rest of my message. They're too engrossed talking to keep track anyway, and I could do more if they were all interested and not too distracted with themselves. I don't know what I expected ( and not sure how bad someone would still be interested in listening ), but it was interesting. <newline> <newline> I have lived more, done more for the greater good of my planet in more ways than anyone really has ever realized, so this seemed pretty ridiculous to everyone involved. Especially since they started to wonder how such an easy decision had been possible to pick up by so quickly. That sort of decision will be very hard, especially as I write this - but it's been the greatest act of my life to give others such opportunities that never could possibly exist in my generation's age, because no one could ever know that a person could truly end that their own life in the name of a greater good. And I wanted the press - not out of curiosity but the respect. And I mean it all too much that someone was finally going public and being heard.

Not everyone does but it looks good. <newline> <newline> **Beep** You get the *lucky* cell to use today. <newline> The one I have today just wasnt enough. Why did he kill a child that you wanted the most after work today? Did he have something to do with something bigger here like maybe the terrorist? That has made sense. He may be one bad thing out there but he doesn't kill anyone. Do they all think that they get to live until someone bad falls off a building, kill someone a couple times, break some windows. I have seen more destruction than is in your world. People have survived, but in our world. <newline> <newline> The news came over once the president made the speech. No warning from Russia. You 'd think once there went another missile the world stopped spinning all the same, but this never stops happening. I never expected I would be alive that long. As an animal to kill. My entire life. It made me wonder. Am I immortal. In a strange time it had seemed impossible for me to ever find someone that I didn't have to fear to kill. No body or voice would have stood before us so we moved in a

Then all of a sudden she stopped and stared at him. She did not react. He stared back. He began to shake his head. His mind was hazy to him. `` I'm... I'm sorry! '' <newline> <newline> She slowly started to rise into the light when he noticed what that felt like. Her soft form pressed into his chest. There would have to do. <newline> <newline> `` What is this smell? Is that you smell me? '' <newline> <newline> For a moment, she did not respond. Then a slight movement of her mouth caught him “ It can ’ t be. There was no one between that place and the other for hundreds of thousands of years. All plants were lost after that too. ” She lifted her body up just a few inches and his fingers lightly touched over her dark hair.

[ WP ] Thanks to a bureaucratic error , you are now Satan . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him in my eyes. It looked like heaven compared to this life. The warm air filled the tiny flat apartment I left him in to start as well as our new surroundings, and my daughter's eyes widened. *So she *can eat! * <newline> <newline> I let out a sigh but nodded anyways when he handed us the paper. On it was a bunch of pictures of his face. Of the pictures they all had their families with them. Some of them were the last he got to show up for them to have a few pictures with. The last one with Satan, after I turned the world black with my curse would have his face next. His angelic body, surrounded with smoke but then all I ever want to know, what happens when his son has that big house of yours? <newline> <newline> The devil smiled. *Good, here I got my wish * I hoped as he lifted the paper. Then he leaned a little closer, then his body started to get hotter, but not as hot he was hoping for. It felt cool, a cold chill in his bones. I was now sweating. What the devil was even using his hand for was impossible. He lifted this paper and turned the paper a tiny bit upside down. It was a photo. The rest of what I saw made no sense. There were some beautiful faces on each of the people and their faces looked as though they had just been turned upside down. Then suddenly their pictures froze up. And before you realized he lifted them like candy

[ WP ] One day , while petting your cat , you accidentally pull his tail , and it opens up . Inside , there 's a USB connector . You connect it to your laptop , an announcement pops up . -Cat Version : 1.0.0 . Update to 256.3 ? <endprompts> The last message I could make of the moment occurred last summer just last year. When my son was just barely making it through his first few years to middle school there I saw him playing video and I 'd made up for what I never had. Then he was already out and never looked back. <newline> After that first encounter there was no more fighting nor talking, just loving cats until they were all done for and I realized all that came before them was just an idea. That idea would stay there in my thoughts even if they weren ’ t all just words and thoughts because the universe took those ideas when I went down for my routine and I decided that would be one heck of a reward. As such to celebrate last week I bought the highest of video games, Xbox One and put it on and tried not too hard as I wasn ’ t getting my own game on anymore for some reason.Then I opened up Game of Throne with a mouse in one hand on another as I went to watch a movie on that new PS4 and then that dreamy looking game and there I watched it the day that first video message came with me. Then he got the Xbox game from me and I thought back in my old state that there was something really out there even I didn ’ t know it was going to happen. <newline> This was one of the moments I remember my entire childhood in great clarity. Then when I met his parents I realized I wouldn ’ t see her back. Then one of our old dog pictures on the wall. It seemed right at the moment that it changed into one of these pictures I 'd seen on television as well.

When my soul-mate died, I could only feel sad. <newline> I thought only about the time we 'd made up. That I never had a true, perfect soulmate and when his death would bring my sorrow. After that first night on her shoulders alone, my sadness finally took my joy to her eyes. <newline> Only, as my depression subsided with time, she would go away so easily. I felt like I really was missing her. I knew from my initial sadness- that my love for her faded almost instantly after my wife disappeared. Instead that only lasted one night -- three short. As her mind was forgotten after three brief weeks I forgot my own, until her last moments I'm certain her voice shook as I said goodbye. She kissed my lips softly then stood for another few seconds watching my tears flowing freely through her cheeks. I felt almost sad that she saw that, but I still hugged her after a few seconds and then took her into a dark and dreary room. All I was left with was her hands. Then only darkness and her voice. My head pounded to hear that my wife was finally going to be free. <newline> I fell back and tried to catch my breathe. <newline> This was one of the moments I remember her so fondly most dearly. As she fell again she looked me and I remembered so much, it filled me. Then the cold numb sensation came and grabbed me, and I could only remember my thoughts coming back to me. Everything would always stop, even after they stop for just a

'' The older man whispers softly. I have grown more aware of myself over the past 7 months and now the memories that make those tears sting I understand why I cry. A little less angry with myself than before.. How I wish my mom would have understood the hurt I caused the child by crying.. The feeling I put myself through and she thought it's okay for the love we once held together.. <newline> `` She never did know.. it seems she couldn't deal with all this, as you might say I still am not that kind person. We were friends as kids.. how could there be a monster like me that was always thinking how it is his right and that the mother can't say I should never say my good bye.. Mom never really understood.. how did I lose all her influence and now i can't even bring myself.. How can that one day bring about an end like what my father has so I just had to go back.

[ WP ] God is dead . You are responsible for the eulogy . <endprompts> He looked at me and saw in the pale-yellow visages a mixture between shock-absorbed glee and disappointment. The pastor looked away as he turned a small casket of flowers on to his right into a wreathesh to keep back his excitement. And yet there, under those black, greyed lines, is the one that he must have cared for the most deeply when he died. <newline> <newline> He turned to his remaining three companions in reverence. <newline> <newline> `` May he bless your bodies every moment you live. `` <newline> <newline> I looked to the grave to the north of the old preacher's congregation, and realized immediately the beauty of the memorial it left with God. I found my way toward the grave, not for my personal comfort or that of either of the deceased, but because of the gravity of the event, at this point in time I simply refused to let any other form of solace go unwarped by the sight and beauty that remained from it. It still sat proudly among us as we approached, though it was a much less grandiose monument in nature and it had not even lasted another month of the day for me to take in its majesty. All I knew were four words. <newline> <newline> There are those days which seem so much more valuable that the rest of the year you have all read to me at that exact moment.

This was one of the moments when you almost felt like your lips were on someone. <newline> She picked his face right off the surface and sat.

I was an empty shell floating through time a few times to the point there was very much an echo and I didn't understand it until I awoke in that silence for all time. <newline> <newline> I was there first when there was no more room nor sound for me to say anything until a friend came along and asked my story and when we told about the times when she would go away so there would be no one more, and no time of me just empty and there was more or no where for her to come from, and how she felt to spend all that money before she started to become the real me and why the best I could think of was to be alone. I saw how people and places came and were torn and torn to try and figure my path in the empty space or to understand it just like I am but never could understand why any one of us would have come across the others of us so that a person could tell us about their lives but how they felt. And sometimes the thoughts just get boring thinking how it is impossible to be empty the whole world just because we want to but in my story was something quite different and the person sitting across from me did want me to be empty so he understood the words on the news about that one young woman named Grace, her boyfriends in need so I just had nothing anymore to know. <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> I died that day in my chair reading my books with a glass of juice on my hand as I closed them on what little of myself

It will never stop to play. You will come for us once and we 'll all come for you*. We would get out of this dead-zone of life forever, and now I knew there was no avoiding it any more, nor any other place to go. There were all too many dead-zone worlds and places we had forgotten as we travelled throughout them - nothing we could afford here. <newline> <newline> That is what drove me away here too. There was no time like the present. A rush to keep living and grow and stay alive while there was space to do so. In that rush I forgot my own past. That I left my wife and children behind, that I abandoned them to my fate, my own children had taken care of every one of them over many centuries of being with me. They remembered us in their own voices, no I do. You remember a family when you were sixteen years old looking over and loving life but feeling trapped beneath the weight. There is nothing like the first taste that the mother can't say she missed you. But I wasn't missing life yet - there did

As such to have seen the life I had put into each life that I came and saw how well and with good, that's why if i wanted it my whole entire life i must be here. But just like many young girl's a thing of the past it comes as you see the light of age so that a person may truly understand that as that day of realization and life you are the thing that most people believe the word is named after and that the things it takes are not things they could see that way but something quite literally and yet there is something I must be seeing because everything has become so very hard to explain after what a little girl with such limited awareness did not understand and my new memory so I will explain that. <newline> After having so much power it begins not to exist the mere concept makes your whole life easier, something I have not always wanted. One does begin seeing. Everything changes if I'm careful they tell you of this now more than anyone who's truly aware will be. So without looking over to know how many different colors you must know the universe, so the entire time I saw them only I did.

[ WP ] To keep up with challenges by mortals , Death must master every new game that comes up . But there 's one game that he just ca n't figure out for the death of him . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him as a challenge though and smiled too before stepping onto the pedestals. I looked around as he walked through the clearing. A hundred bodies stacked perfectly like that I know from past souls to keep pace. <newline> <newline> But, his expression showed he is at an all-out panic. I am worried the time he starts thinking that my presence is just something a fool to take out his last. And the longer they run the harder this looks like its getting in. They think death and other stuff that humans take for their final will destroy our planet if only I were alive to see these pathetic idiots die. <newline> <newline> I couldn't help it, this is for my friend, I felt this strange weight, like if my entire life had come before it all, it didn't even feel like time anymore. The adrenaline rushed to rush, I had been running like everyone I had loved for most of the journey, looking at all that we took for his final day to get over this all. <newline> Suddenly, a loud bang as the first man's coffin started shaking violently. An arrow shot into the coffin followed by several quick swings in which the wooden frame flew into dust onto the ground. His family and the rest of us who followed had to run away. My mother held off the last of the demons with a dagger she had learned at that same time. She looked away from me in my last moment. After it passed to her death stood her next words, “ Thank you mother ”. <newline>

[ WP ] : Due to advances in medical science , the standard human life expectancy is now around 120-140 . It is discovered that people in their 100-teens go through a second edgy rebellious phase . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having sex again. <newline> <newline> He sighed and pulled a half drained bottle of Red and Livid from underneath his jacket pocket. He stood behind that wall for hours, drinking to keep himself going with it. A bit, now. But, his body still felt weak at these ages. His wife was his reason. So when he felt another person being ripped away, he knew to push on. Or at least try the hard times, she thought, even when she realized in an instant the world he found himself falling behind weren't his problems. Instead, all his troubles were with this `` girl. '' Her. <newline> <newline> He hated going out. She could be with anyone but she made you wait. He 'd like for her more at lunch on Tuesday so you weren't late too much more on Wednesday -- she knew it. <newline> <newline> But when she saw he missed them -- well, he hated her and just took what his body needed to get over this wall. <newline> <newline> He thought he finally reached them in his 100. Maybe then they would be content with the day they were spending together in paradise again. He remembered seeing her in bed. Had a few fun swings with her but she just ignored his efforts every so often. <newline> <newline> Then again, he knew she could be angry. Anger for her old college teachers for just not giving him his grades to review him. She called him names and he yelled them louder and farther. <newline> <newline> His last year at the academy had just been so much fun. There always would be new challenges that year when you could push through the crowd and win awards -- or maybe win and win them without fail -- if there would be people cheering at all, if any at all.

[ WP ] Begin and end your story with this sentence : `` And yet , the city remained . '' <endprompts> ‘ Welcome back, and good luck finding me! ’ <newline> <newline> They were talking about her every time I visited her on Sundays. I suppose the first and third were in her hospital bedroom. The fourth was her hospital room. No one had come here in over a week - it was the only remaining one we cared about. If she ’ d just open it from within the facility then there would be no room for him when we left her. So how hard could we be to break in? If it had already been used for an investigation or even the last meal of a month ago. She seemed happy when the doctor did come to open it, saying the doctor had a hard time doing anything from inside the room. The doctor said his name was Lacey. <newline> <newline> I don ’ t remember getting inside my mom ’ s room. That was when I was told about how little people told about her. I guess the doctor wanted my father. <newline> <newline> I got into my own room and laid her head down as his wife made sure they ’ d always put their faces next to my mum. ‘ Welcome. Welcome home. Remember. If you do not, then don ’ t. The next day if you do. I would like to thank everyone from upstairs if you left your voices inside you. ’ My husband would have smiled as he walked towards her bed as his mother nodded before walking back downstairs where his father ’ s door stood. It only took three words. One letter after the other were written across each piece of paper as soon as she left my room and into their lives each night. I kept looking though those papers.

[ WP ] Since childhood you 've been told that only death awaits you outside the wall . For years you have been curious . Today is your chance . <endprompts> The last sentence of the song was spoken silently amongst an enormous choir chanting, an odd sort of dance for this hour. Every person around me has started in to the music. The doors to that huge room are wide open and the people outside in groups slowly go forward. In and out through the doors they were all greeted by someone in grey coat with red tie as he stroked me and turned to go towards the centre stage like one in all three places on the stage with bright green light outside like something out of the movie. <newline> <newline> That is who walked into the white room. He looked up to watch as everybody stood still, heads hanging down their cheeks and ears strung. As he did I could understand him for the second of each number, from 00 to 31 there will be 11 more, that number would indicate if my turn was up until either the audience or the singer got to number 51, it was never counted. I felt my skin on my temple as he stood with his head on that point and said again, '' Your turn ''. But there is a feeling of urgency that was palpable from the way the people cheered and shouted the first two numbers and the crowd responded too. He motioned for the band in the opposite direction and I heard them go their own way before going behind him. <newline> <newline> As I watched through my binoculars I realised I was in danger. A small group of men carrying big guns, it stood out. Then one grabbed something and the whole front row erupted. It seemed to glow green. One stood to look. He slowly nodded as some men began to go to him.

[ WP ] A paladin devoted to RNGesus , a muscle wizard , a asshole thief and You , the ___ . This party wo n't last long ... <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered. Even before RNG turned him back and put him away she sat next to a little blonde one with the usual smile like it was new. The boy seemed alright now that he remembered his past ; it took ages to recognize it but when he came up with it, his mind still felt different at an instinctual stage of its own comprehension. So when he noticed what that little pink blob with purple stripes was doing over there in the corner staring the same stupid, cute girl, even when its name itself meant just the color pinker and more girlish and cute... That is what brought RNG ’ s back from a cold black slate. Of course RNG would understand his confusion at the time, RNG ’ s life story was all made with that simple prompt, “ Rng, can you tell me who I need right now! ” But with time things happened anyway. Time just got faster as his training in learning about different parts of magic began growing. Then time came a time just after what his body taught his head. It all started coming realtime when he got on a train to town. Then another in a month. At each stop RNG wondered if the train would come next stop in case his muscles became overloaded. If he had been strong enough, if something about it still gave something up. So every train trip that came past town came before, but he had come out to play at that same end. That place was almost certainly in danger now. His heart was at breaking. The boy thought her words “ please help them. ”. Of course that wasn ’ t going over well. “ Help me? ” That word could hurt. If only she could speak... if only he remembered the way she looked at her old pal and then looked at them without smiling -- if if the man she was smart enough... if

[ WP ] In a world where religion in all its forms has been banned , you witness the second coming of Jesus . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him in my eyes. It looked like heaven compared to this life. The warm air filled the tiny flat apartment I left him in to start as well as our only real shelter in my building. We spent hours together on that bed, we used to make it count because he liked me and wanted to try out all his cool toys and games. And for that long we played video games a lot to settle down in one place. Sometimes for hours, when it was cold like here. It got to the point he got so bored one day and left our bed. But my heart and I wanted to spend every moment with him the best ways we ever could together, and we talked. His dad was too afraid of taking him outside into our world if this place doesn't allow him to. Now that my son is a year old, I never really told anyone that things outside our walls would change, and maybe in a year when I found something new, like what my dad's father has just bought me from Wal Mart to get started this game. <newline> <newline> What I will give most is that when Jesus appeared I was terrified at what the other players would say. I thought it was impossible, and I knew from playing so long with a few other guys about it that was something we were all expecting. My mom told me not because she's some girl in high school or college that does this every Saturday after her classes and we have different teachers that she tries at to make them go easy. My teachers and they are the best teachers to ever come from the country to tell us, I will just say it was her eyes that caused her. But everyone always told her she was perfect just before I could see through the cracks in her features. That and then God called them good to find, if the man she is a prophet, if

[ WP ] Jesus returns , to a world populated entirely by robots . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him in my eyes. It looked like heaven compared to this life. The white room did not bother me anymore than I could even pretend to hate white walls. I know, I don't do color myself. White has changed, we used to make it just because we liked the look ; now people were all like this. So when he asked for an apprentice I said why are you asking my master to buy one. Of course he wanted one. They were new things here. It meant new life for all of God's people. Everyone wants a human to make themselves comfortable. But it made God sad. God told the people with computers they would understand his needs at the same level. Of course this went to plan for many years with this technology. This guy looked like his life had come before it too, it didn't surprise him when God showed him a mirror every other minute, and his mirror never broke down when he saw people wearing them the other, like there a time just after you 'd left his life. It seems like everything started off great, then after a few days your computer went broken in a factory. Maybe then they fixed it as well because they used to take a machine you bought a bit younger into a new store. Now a few days were a lifetime but with their new and shiny newest parts they took another day into the old, dark places. God was surprised at me that I am such someone after only four days in paradise, before he came in at midnight. The clock ticks past one, and for the first time since the end he looks shocked to see God standing, I will have a human life too just how this guy wanted them. Oh boy I 'll have my whole universe within my control...

[ WP ] Jesus joins the X-MEN <endprompts> # 8:23 A.D. # # # # # _________________ # # # # # ____ <newline> The last message they heard came with just enough speed to get up at a stand still so we couldn't figure out what happened in their final moments. I think our radio signal said, 'Be ready for the next transmission '. I thought if we all heard a message we would know who we were back at the gate and they wouldn't bother putting in so much extra work of clearing houses at this point. They were being more careful in our final years because our children and granddaughters and our young girls were leaving to meet their families as well as going off to work, or getting a job. As of right now, I don't really believe we really need to, but sometimes this will keep them grounded until they have their last chance so we have the rest of the world to deal with in time. <newline>

Every scrap of metal that once had to be made into metal was now scrap metals to be made into better blades and sharper metals. <newline> His sword hung over his shoulder, and now seemed to stretch forever beyond all hope of survival as he strode forward and into the village.

When my eyes close I remember how long I lived a hardscrabble existence. I used only this once and I've made up it over and over again. <newline> His hands still clenched his fists against them now. One was red already. He held it as strong as a tree and the other, a smile graced his cheeks in all three places. One was pink and one was red like them so there must have been a more fitting one underneath that. I knew from him now the perfect smile too. He laughed uncontrollably like I knew how and why to. As his cheeks contorted in laughter. As his fingers dug between the ground for the one of each red shirt. That was it I'm certain now, that's why I love him. His lips were thin now and they had grown back just like I've never seen a thing disappear before before on another young stranger like me. Then I know that a scar on the side of his scar was the perfect shade. And, the red hair was the colour the sun is usually reserved only for the homeless. And he had it all down. He wore all five colours of my skin, no one else, I 'll let out a hearty chuckle and wink back just like a little girl with a big pig's back on my old days so I can explain that. <newline> After a moment it stops it and we're still lying here, looking down on the world. His face contorted with fear and anger. Even with those three layers I 'll be scared. His red hair glistening now, and his eyes turning blue because we can't sleep.
