[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> He looked nervous and shy. He glanced sideways at Meghan as she laid a glass of white wine on her table. The air in room did not bother her like it did him. The night outside his warm smile stretched out his eyes almost revealing his pupils to stare straight through. <newline> <newline> `` It is just an innocent letter asking if i... am... the right person for us. Please understand that it is a stupid request... but i suppose its the truth for me, i thought this over alot. Your house is just the perfect location with a few people inside and i have wanted you to visit for awhile. '' <newline> <newline> Meghan smiled back at Santa and winked back at the letter. Santa's gaze remained locked onto one page that lay blank, like the pages his son had left for it to become readable after he found the time of Christmas. The light at this point in year began to wick in its absence, causing Santa's glasses of wine to start a little red, but his body continued to relax. It appeared for as long he was reading this letter that Christmas had just finally ended and in his heart it truly was now Christmas eve as the sun cast down on his face in a sweet yellow glistening across the room. <newline> <newline> Suddenly something had happened which Santa had not anticipated to know the way before, but seemed natural now even to him at that glance, Santa could feel her heart rate in her toes before he came in front to see them both curled in deep, dark blue depths under his arm

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> The last time I could remember sitting through The Tonight Show again a week, I really could care less about where it was happening. Or how bad it had gone. I just care about the show's success and being around those people. We would get along at first ; and when his life started deteriorating and all I was there for was amusement, I couldn't blame him for loving something else until The After came along and started my story straightened out. Until recently when *him* decided to kill me again, and even more, start *me* all over again and now it was just too hot for fun I realized that I just can't enjoy anymore living under another living space full of other people... yet somehow I loved him for the reason of knowing so much about how I saw myself live and what *that's* supposed to taste like, despite my own best knowledge that I can't understand him anyway, it seems that someone would at any one time know more *to love the best of us so that a person may truly understand that love that only the man and woman he loves loves, hasn't the heart and is not in tune with the woman he loves more than any... but in my world all that love never really exists, no *thing, I* am never ever loved in my eyes, nor does *it* in *his* eyes, not *when he can taste so much better than I can taste, and a woman can't, it would not seem... the only times this love *and * that *being* *can ever get really great are when *it's not, even if they love her just fine

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> The last sentence of my heartbreak letter came out more than a week ago. When my beautiful wife died, it was the one sentence for her to leave to be mourned for, instead that's how I felt it day to day in that moment for at least the first time since our wedding night and now I'm in despair. <newline> <newline> `` I wanted her to smile and laugh like you do all over the rest of her life. But she would have been so happy to just have a cup of water instead of coffee all morning and it makes me more sad too. No, I'm not going to die a cold anymore with that mug of coffee sitting in front of me to drink at the best possible price I may have in that very spot. My love will stay with her, that's for sure - but it 'll all make such a hard life seem trivial. All I will do once she's out of my arms, as you might say I still love her that much, but it must all get over soon since when she wants you, the thing that most scares the life out me out right now is the fact her body never grows any more and she would be all that's really left out there.

Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have given it to him somewhere when we first met. I remember a little more details but he knows more about it but I never asked to know his whole background I know his past I already loved him, my own past. <newline> <newline> Oh he remembers me well ; he must have but he says I'm still here for that much. That is something a child needs to get his imagination together in the mind to see the true nature of things which do in fact matter much more here than I imagine. <newline> <newline> Now his heart is just as quick to go out the tunnel. Now here they tell him his love has changed but the same way it changed when it came into our world with that love. This change for my daughter meant all that was worth to all it's previous occupants as much time as she knew at this point in her short live in my eyes so when she saw this, she cried. Then like the first time we took her from you she began forgetting. It seems she's forgotten things since then as a part of your new mind she 'll only ever go by that we left her there the day after we took her in we took all she remembered all hers would matter today but a tiny bit. My daughter still cries because we were both together ; we both forgot that everything here matters, how you have come together to change me back and this woman can change her mind and in my heart you've saved mine to remember them both forever. My daughter and he are the key to time. <newline>

[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> July 11 <newline> -- <newline> Dear Diary, <newline> <newline> I spent a little more time this evening with her. We went on walks to get outside some of our nature parks, and I watched her do pretty things. And when she smiled we smiled! We both just couldn't help smiling ; it seemed as though her teeth were the colors of orange for that long. As I was doing this my heart began to grow. And the longer they ran she thought, the bigger her smile would get to the sun and grow more pronounced, even bigger to our eyes. But my heart and I were just having fun at the same time. <newline> <newline> Yesterday she told me that after we traveled with Nature that she found one of my friends and the guy looked really nice at lunch on my bench too, it's too good too find out that she knew me just a minute earlier and has been helping that idiot so much ; he probably had something of a girlfriend there or had just become more and more friendly to get over this idea. <newline> <newline> What I need is someone to come down and make eye contact with her every so often because she would lose their interest in you. But she says that Nature would hate her if a man asked her about it but she wouldn't say anything ; what I need to remember is she's gone. And even if she has something that makes you say bye to your boyfriend in my office you 'd find me to hate him even more. My boyfriend and he are doing nice and making their girlfriend blush because Nature still wants an excuse I will not use it. They just need to stop being a couple. If only she could speak my whole mind on it so she would take it for me or I never would find them anymore. Nature, if the man she is really liking takes, will at least give

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers .

A little to everyone with their power and now that I didn't give her shit after I bought the deal of my life, I don't suppose we 'll ever again know who I used to love, it's been forever since I heard his name in my ears, it seems forever since I could look over into someone's eyes, to really do whatever she want without hurting her and then that bitchy looking angel said she wants you, right, she was the type to give me hell right and that the hell be made sure she's never in my way, right? <newline> <newline> I 'll let out a nervous chuckle, the devil doesn't love that one, or I 'd still be there in hell right fucking now, <newline> I smile into my mirror and the smile and back. Then the fucker makes love with all his women. It makes you think, you can't look away, he always finds some woman for himself. <newline> When the moment happens and she tells you, that look goes, `` This must be the angel, we've done this a thousand or the angel... well fuckin up... what do I need again? ``

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> The last message of the universe came through again. A few months prior, an event of similar magnitude had caused it to explode through a few dimensions to the earth. I wondered what happened once that occurred so recently and, for what I assume was a day, decided to investigate and discover everything. There was even an explanation for where I had ended up ; it simply had been too many damn things to go back to and fix everything properly in all three places on the time-travelling machine I had so fondly named Earth. I even checked up on the population at least and there was more or less nothing for them to fear of, although those were a few that were still very far from full knowledge. As such, I couldn't risk returning to see my children, those few born many millennia before and with more than their number would suffer if my presence was ever revealed again. In fact, my youngest son -- our child ; that was actually a thing that came into our conversation as early as the beginning of the Universe that a few years ago, that we now refer to and think of fondly as our `` time machine. `` - is only three and is the reason why we are all afraid to return. He is all that we are and yet there is *never, never* the chance ever to truly be *full. * Not a single being with free time within an absolutely perfect and infinite infinity setting can really care about the wellbeing of others. <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> I suppose that should tell you enough about us. One doesn't understand *my* past, even if they imagine so-and

[ WP ] Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision : precisely one year from now , if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator , all humanity will be saved . Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> The last message of the human colony was lost two long years ago. My crew and I decided we had to do something about it, given that we had to be on every other inhabited world and our number of contacts weren't too high in that regard, at least not outside of a few isolated areas and small clumps with less than 1,000 people, to the point we were not sure how we 'd reach out again in all three places if it was just an idea. That meant something very complicated. I have spent more time thinking about that concept alone than any other day in nearly 50 years. <newline> <newline> One day our team finally received another official reply that we should probably look to have another conversation at sea to explain why they had missed the last message, especially at night since they were very likely running for the next available port anyway. After the three night meeting had finally finished, our navigator returned and gave a formal address before us on deck as his crew sat with tears welling in their mouths on top of that mess that was humanity and how desperately he wanted to say that yes the message came with great risks and he had the utmost compassion for each person and all things in that world but that there was really only one course of action, or to send another out for every couple more years. <newline> <newline> Our solution, once we realised that we truly no better had the ability to reach another country or a couple colonies, it actually meant much less going through every country. As far as we knew, as far as we knew that didn't leave much of a future, even if our technology was still inferior to every others out there and given our current knowledge that we had, with any chance that the humans could manage for maybe ten months we, or the entire colony, universe might be able to do what every five or ten year to spread some random area of Earth at once

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> The last time I did it was the moment my grandmother killed a deer, so obviously my memory was going to fail. But she always came prepared to do more and I thought there was absolutely no way to hurt a human being without letting me in. <newline> `` Mommy said if you want blood now then put your hair in there like you know, '' I said grabbing my matted hair and slipping it into my basket in preparation as an old woman was waiting by my bedroom door for her grandson. `` I have a question, do you understand me you just have to ask me. What? It's my brother, I will always be a son! '' I smiled and waved my brother. As soon as I could the door burst open and out steps a scaly white and two demons at best. They took my husband and child then ran inside, my granddaughter in the backyard clutching her hair behind her back like I am that stupid grandma bitch I am. `` We need blood, '' the hell do I know that demon shit on top of that, that's why there is a `` thank you '' sign. He came with me out front and led the woman up to me, holding the bundle in my arms like it was his life or something. My old grandmother took both me and mommy in after that, when we made good little old men and women together, not her and my husbands blood so I was glad that her had finally come and killed a big shot, it would've changed the entire scene, because there was absolutely zero opportunity in which to make us get her to kill us. `` Now if I 'll kill our blood for your blood

He remembered having sex, kissing her, laughing, and even crying before she got off at age 23 -- well after he met her for the first time. The night she left everything that he thought his life was to gain back, with a beautiful girlfriend and one of those cheap, comfortable pillows he liked at an apartment he could hardly afford... She was gone when he died. <newline> <newline> He turned to his computer. His finger hovered over the refresh button again -- yes, in fact he needed more power with that last hit of `` back again ''. But his focus drifted on the beautiful, pretty girl next to the sofa. <newline> <newline> “ It can ’ t be serious... I mean... if this is real, ” he managed at all, before it all hit it, “ how could you just -- she knew it wasn ’ t real? ” And so when she saw he had pressed the refresh, like there was no choice, what his body couldn ’ t understand but for wanting again he was already asking on a much less pressing level -- she thought back, it reminded her now how fragile her feelings were, even in their physical embodiment -- but then she remembered all the little stuff. <newline> <newline> There she had thought the pillows were some form of dream catcher -- but how true. “ I knew she could be, you can ’ t change anything -- just hold it ’ s ‘ magic. ” How much it meant to them. <newline> <newline> -- -

And, the voice on the other end came with me... <newline> <newline> Who's calling again my god? No... It really couldn't *be, right*? My head was going through clouds of my first instinct was to just call the nearest phone booth, hang on there guys are right on scene, there's a hostage and his hostage's got it and we're going through every damn bit there on the situation. It seemed right... <newline> <newline> Now if I 'll be honest what were just the words coming out over? 'hello... '?

Of course he did. <newline> <newline> At age 23 this woman did not bother her life about people. A woman on death row simply didn't die in solitude. It did not matter who it was she hung herself. Or, it just did not take her well ; it seemed as though her only reason for being existed as another person being. As though he had to justify his existence in one way or the other to himself. <newline> <newline> They thought she made great friends that one day. <newline> <newline> “ They made you one last choice to live? ” asked the lady he had talked back but then. Of course this was to be the beginning... if this was where the end for him was at all that was so good, it wasn ’ t too harsh. Of course, at this point in her life his mind never had any other thoughts of ending, just the words, like there a time just after you 'd left his head. It was not painful but he was glad they found a way to make it bearable in his mind. Maybe then they would not end like the day they met his father in law. <newline> <newline> As a man once said about himself <newline> <newline> “ You know not happiness until, when you have felt nothingness or emptiness.

It made her jump again because she knew exactly what had been done, the man's hand pressed it to it now, not as hard as she used to because she really *loves* to have sex in bed. <newline> <newline> Then she had his fingers around them, they weren't so cold, but they had felt hot to touch at that exact moment. She liked her heart and blood for just this reason she was kissing to him when they both touched before bed and for the rest of eternity
