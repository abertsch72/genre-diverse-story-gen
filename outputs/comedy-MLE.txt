Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> **Day 1** <newline> <newline> The rain falls fast, bringing a dampness over it. This is certainly going to be a hard morning after last evening in San Antonio, especially for what we have decided. Not much will go into this trip, mostly I'm sure we will get our feet stuck with all of this... but then so do I! I 'll take advantage of it. <newline> <newline> The sky was bright with a thick blue blanket covering up the light of day from my window, a brilliant sunrise coming up the sky after so many long winters away here. It's been hard here of course. I was so sure these lights are meant solely to look at the world after all... but all I can't give my eyes. This is really what life feels like? These lights that's supposed to guide people are all for people they don can't see. We make it all a thing, these days, but in our primitive age of time there used to only be so very many people in need to show how little humanity can do for such a magnificent machine. The sun is down now, a cool shade to look at. I know my mother never misses this little time, she always takes those to have a nice sunset on the patio. The way I see, even Mother Nature knows it's not the greatest time of year.

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him from behind. <newline> <newline> I stood up in a pool of sweat. He stared back. A smile came to his face. I tried not to smile to keep my spirits with him. A bit, too. But, his expression showed he liked me well enough. His smile was like the waves from a lake. And that was okay. <newline> <newline> There would have to be a sacrifice. Someone I 'd put out in an instant for my power. This was one of them. And a sacrifice to my pride and lusting. Who else would I put the child? <newline> <newline> “ Lucifer?

It had long ears. <newline> <newline> My body lurched slightly. It tried to jump again, to move faster on its hands as I stood. Again. Just a small bit then suddenly I jumped into the lake again, moving at a dizzying pace all over the water. I stood there with a few more inches until it started to come up. I laughed at what I figured to be hilarious absurdity, how absurd. “ I 'll bring another, please, as a substitute, in my office before he can steal mine to sell ‘

How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> > You had a purpose in existence I realized with a feeling of relief knowing a universe as you know it as is over... well never to return after countless decades as what now it is. When the Gods do not intervene, we move. They never were and yet we were created and are here on our own accord. My purpose now? To simply witness a universe to make the world right again. No human, god, spirit etc. to interfere. I shall end this existence you mortal. I shall no longer watch humanity and only allow to give humanity a better and more stable future. In this time I shall see that I never got tired to see every world, just enough to see those who gave the most pain, for it is an eternal price of your suffering. This, is Hell, that is for those who wouldn't want to deal with suffering again. <newline> <newline> <newline> **You're doing it **.

The conversation continued a while in Satan's head, ''So why haven't any humans stopped bothering or stopping these gods or gods.

[ WP ] Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision : precisely one year from now , if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator , all humanity will be saved . Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> Every day is a chore in hell I realized my inner monologue upon hearing a call as I stared with confusion into a room as crowded with other people as it is with hell. As more faces are gathered to give condolences to those lost I became aware my mind was only a machine and reality a puppet. The one I was attempting to follow though the crowd was more powerful in their thoughts than all I was aware. And this feeling drove my resolve to finish the job i was doing. <newline> After giving everyone of them enough time to give more condolences and to comfort those who felt the same sorrow for their loved one whom are likely dead they began taking down the walls, but as those walls fell they began demolishing the streets themselves until the screams of people everywhere can fill the halls from their hearts. This is because, without enough time to give them enough time to have their last moment with them with the rest of humanity on Earth, the other angels are given another glimpse by having a final encounter they knew they wanted but didnt expect when humanity has finally gone extinct to live somewhere else and are soon no-where. Now i, the last being who felt alone, and lonely, with only God and God alone in my life. How long do i have yet to see a happy end, yet only an unhappiness from myself. What's the point of living once someone like me were around, to become like one that was supposed to have passed... when humanity and the universe itself no longer exists? <newline>

Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> Every day is a lesson in self-discipline, which I've picked to put my self-worth into full effect as soon as I was a small man with just enough confidence. When my mum started selling food at 8AM I asked about my mum and he told me 'No she was working'<newline> My confidence got the best of me and in the years since all I really learned is never ever doing things when I feel nervous, and to always just do what is in your power to accomplish the desired tasks at this point in my life. <newline> In this modern era being successful has come easily and I made my money for years just getting by as well as others do. Being an ambitious and a lazy child that often doesn't learn, is never easy you've been told, but never this difficult to accomplish? <newline> If all goes according to the chart a nice house, good looks no matter of who you choose for you then congratulations ; it looks like your family can always support and help you out when everything is stacked so in my books I 'll just be getting ahead again! For some reason I get distracted, just when I had all the self esteem going to town, I don't do the dishes or do any important tasks like going for any kind of project, instead I decide a nice simple pot is perfect ; or rather that's all they need, a good little pot....with me..
