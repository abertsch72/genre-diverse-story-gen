[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals .

'' he asked. `` You get to be Santa, and you get to write presents for everyone. '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah, '' I said, `` I don't.

I've been trying to stop you from sending gifts to me. It seems silly, but I just can't stop myself. It's so damn cute, it's making Christmas so much more than what it used to be. '' <newline> <newline> `` You're cute. '' I said. `` It's just... what's that? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well, '' Santa said, `` If your son keeps writing letters for you, it's going to be Christmas. You're Santa. '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait! '' I said. `` It's just that this just won't make much sense, because I just don't have any... '' <newline> <newline> `` What?

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> The last time I had heard about the `` roommate '' rule, I had taken it up on the `` don't ask '' list for a week. To be fair, there were others that I 'd made fun of before I went in, but for some reason `` roommate '' had seemed to keep going, I 'd become increasingly curious. It couldn't be real, and I wanted to make the best of it, but all it would take was some simple `` *hic* '', no `` I have a roommate, and *hic, just have him call me '' or `` *hic, I'm going to be late to class, I don't know if I'm gon na be up or down to pick up my books, I don't know how much longer I have, I'm gon na miss it, I can't be there, I don't want it, please come home, '' nonsense, it was as if I was `` supposed '' to be a `` roommate '', that I should not be `` there '' but `` *hic, I'm going to be late to class, I don't know if I'm gon na be up or down to pick up my books, I don't know how long I have, I'm gon na miss it, I can't be there, I don't want it, please come home, '' nonsense. My parents had warned me against coming to college, but `` roommate '' seemed like the obvious choice, as well as, `` what does he know. '' Now, I 'd had a roommate for a week now, but now, it seemed... odd, that I was, `` really, truly, truly, absolutely, `` roommat home, '' the entire time. How weird! I didn't even know anyone, and he had some *no* idea I existed.

[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying . <endprompts> The last time I did it was the summer of 2036. After a few weeks of my routine, I figured I could figure out how to do it more accurately, I had an extensive and detailed set of research, it seemed I was in a much better position than before and if everything went according to plan, I 'd be able to get the damn thing done. <newline> <newline> A few days after my breakthrough, I heard a knock on my door. I groaned, there must be something wrong ; there was no mail, all I wanted to do was hang around for a bit, I went down to my room and looked under the bed. Upon opening, I found nothing, no bills, no credit cards. I put down my briefcase, grabbed the envelope, and left. <newline> <newline> I wasn't in the wrong for doing this ; it turns out, it's actually a thing that you need to do regularly, because the `` catch '' is that a person usually can't get that money back when they get it, so it has to be stored for at least a year, before the money can be recovered. I should've known from the beginning : It's illegal to use anything, or any objects, with anything that can not be explained on the `` other side '', or `` without a signature, '' so I'm just glad that I picked up the right `` catch ''. <newline> <newline> <newline>

I was just a teenager when the news first hit. <newline> <newline> `` They're finally ready, '' my mother exclaimed in a pained tone. `` All those people were waiting for! '' I was terrified. `` I don't know what I 'd do without you, '' I would beg her, my heart breaking for her. `` You made my life! I can't live without you, I'm so glad! I just have to ask you.

Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> The last message I could make of the future was an angry `` NOOOOOOOO! ''. I had been trapped, suspended within time for almost forty years in a universe I thought only existed in that book's mind, and what I thought was merely a concept was nothing but utter bullshit. I could only think of one thing, though. `` That damn damn book ''. For me, it was `` The Omniscient Code '', and it was on the shelf with `` *The Complete Guide to the Multiverse, * '' or, at the time, `` *A Practical Guide To All Occasions. * '' I found that my `` Omniscient Code '' was very far from real, as the words would have taken up too much room on the shelf in that very book. However, at the very back, were `` The Rules '' - guidelines, if you will, to be followed to avoid `` every eventuality '' that could come `` at any moment ''. Needless to say, the `` Multiverse '' that I was trapped in, that I now read over and over again, was the stuff of legend. There was nothing like it in my world. <newline> <newline> `` But, '' I said, `` I don't see any way to get out ''. `` Just, just tell me '', said my younger self, `` If you don't feel like explaining anything, then there is no point.

I'm not sure why, because, with a good time like that, I'm sure I 'd be at least somewhat miserable. <newline> <newline> And for that, I feel guilty, a little bit. There is nothing like the feeling of falling, the crunch, the soft feeling of someone hugging you, your feet hitting the floor, feeling like you have a cold, dry sponge. I wanted it to feel like I could have been touched, but I was too tired to notice. <newline> <newline> At the beginning, I didn't know what to do. I had no idea where to, how, nor why. There was just me. The entire park, in one field of grass. And everyone, even me, had just stopped. <newline> <newline> `` Hey!

How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> God sighed. His first day in office, he 'd been out for two days. A few other gods weren't sure of course, but he knew all of the `` the good and the bad '', including the `` you ''. In all seriousness, though, even though everyone thought he was godly, he could only speak with the same tongue. God, after all, knew all things from within. So, there he sat, on his throne of granite, talking to everyone, at a table near the fireplace. <newline> <newline> `` Listen, you all need to hear me out.
