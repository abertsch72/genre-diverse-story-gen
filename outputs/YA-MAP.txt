[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> *December 25th, 2015* <newline> <newline> I went out with my parents to visit my sister ; I really didn't want to, but I knew there was something special about our family. She came to visit me last spring, it's always nice to see her, it just makes sense for her to visit us this year. I know I'm still not ready to admit it, but sometimes I wish my brother had asked me. Of course, that, was probably because we were going out on our own for the last month. She told me about how our entire planet was dying, and I wanted to join, to help. Her mother, a professor, told her that we couldn't, that our Earth would eventually become a giant, burning corpse. The entire planet had turned into a burning mass of smoke, and all it did, was smothering me. We knew it would be a year, maybe two, that we would need to find another family, but, like the first time we took her, it was to get us through our trials. <newline> <newline> I remember the day she met me, it was a hot, brisk day. I was just starting to take in my surroundings, and I had just turned my phone on. I knew something was up, something was up. I immediately started screaming, then turned into the living, dark room. In front of me was something that, when you look at it, just looks dark. It was a chair. <newline> <newline> `` WHAT?! '' She shouted. `` WE NEED TO GO! '' I stared at her, and her eyes were so empty. I wanted her to stay, to be my whole, `` i ''... she looked at me. And then she looked at her chair. And then at me. So, she went silent, until she reached out and grabbed my hand.

I was only about to leave the house and I looked around my living room in a confused, confused state. `` It's all over! '' I cried out. `` I don't know what I'm doing! '' `` The 'I Don't Know, But I know'was just an idea, '' my girlfriend replied. `` I just haven't done it yet! I just haven't been able to make it!

As I started to pour the warm cooking liquid into the pan, the devil appeared in the kitchen. `` You should check it out, '' said the devil, `` it's very powerful, it's been tested! '' `` Well, well, '' I said, `` what's your big deal? '' `` I have to, '' I said, `` I need it!

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> God sighed. His first day in office, he 'd been out for two days. A few other gods weren't sure of course, but he knew all of the `` the good and the bad '', including the `` you ''. In all seriousness, though, even though everyone thought he was godly, he could only speak with the same tongue. God, after all, knew all things from within. So, there he sat, on his throne of granite, talking to everyone, at a table, in front of the thousands, some of whom hadn't been able to attend his inauguration. He sighed. No one seemed to notice, it didn't matter. For god, he was a god, he just didn't see the point in being any different, to stop a lot of things, but at the same time, not enough to make people happy. Sure, it could get a lot of work done, he 'd seen people suffer for years, sometimes for decades, but at least that was something. But at least, he knew all of the `` how '', and how much pain people's lives go through. God, it seems, never really knows a soul, not since God himself was the one who first made humans, but then, before that, when they came from the sky, no one would take seriously the idea of being a god. <newline> <newline> God thought back to his old days. When humanity wouldn't have expected their creator, they 'd just send one through, and `` that's why there's hell ''. When he woke up the next morning, he 'd know what humans were going through, but when he left, they wouldn't have a clue what was happening anymore, so the people would just go on like this, he used to do, so long ago.

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> The last time I did it was the third day before christmas. My parents and my brother had been planning it together for two weeks, but they had to be stopped. The first time, I 'd made the dishes, I 'd gotten a big plate and shoved everything into it. There was blood all over the plate. `` I killed Satan! '' my mom yelled, `` He brought evil back to my house!

I guess that's why i had been so worried about falling asleep on my bed, right? `` I'm going to stay out all night, '' I would mutter, `` Just wait.
