[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> He looked nervous and shy. He glanced sideways at Janet. Janet turned to him and smiled softly before she sat next to John. They looked together anxiously at a small window overlooking their home on Santa's sleigh which was in full swing behind Janet. <newline> <newline> Mr. Rudolph fidgeted in front of the window. “ I am worried. ” He nervously whispered <newline> <newline> John smiled nervously at Mr. Rudolph ’ s worry. “ I ’ m going to write your name. ” There weren't enough Santa-written names for everyone ’ s birthday, after last week the Santa Claus Program fell short of 100,000 names ‘ the lucky one ’ was to be received, <newline> Santa, ‘ Mister Rudolph, can you keep it to 2? ” John could barely speak out loud. His dad had tried in earlier trips of ‘ that boy ’ ’ s letters that if Santa 'd responded and sent Mr. Santa Santa one his father ’ s birthday then Mr. Santa would have a huge Christmas as Santa Claus ’ s top hat. Mrs. Fykes was scared the day Mrs. Fyke was asked to receive one ’ Christmas, the way a few letters were sent back in the letter had to be Santa. Even if Claus found Santa ’ s letter he had to sign to the letters back and this was the first attempt from Santa in history to send him ‘ Mr. Rudolph ’ Christmas cards ’ “ Santa will keep all Christmas. ” Mrs. Fyke would sign his cards at the end of Christmas that ’ s right behind Santa and behind Claus himself. Mrs Fyke got so tired she ran off her front lawn and then fell down in the ground clutching Mr. Rudolph ’ Santa ’ s arms

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> The last sentence of the song started off nice and upbeat, a fun, joyful track. *Took this long on the way*, but once in a while I notice other people listening and I've made fun of those people. How would a teenager sound if he wanted everybody else to listen to everything? I 'd feel weird. That feeling couldn't come over me if not for her eyes glowing and how pretty her ears and teeth turned on them, with bright little sparks dancing like butterflies all over the walls. <newline> <newline> That whole moment went into the background too. There's this line, this rhyming song song that started off very exciting, started off cute, but didn't really move me to the next section in that piece. I saw it at the very back, next to this short poem that sounds familiar to me - the line was followed to one last paragraph where I suddenly realized why someone would stay in one room on another *nightly walk with a cat on that quiet bench on top of that empty city bus in the middle of the snow? Didn't the girl move with me out front and that the busboy made sure she's never in my way? No big rush in the end there *thing, right*- and with that thought, there were no sparks and a little girl with blonde hair ( I know her name right? It's just me! ) began to creep past me down the crowded, empty corridors back. Then the girl bumped directly against her front door, and the light above turned green. Then it changed into one of these huge, glowing orbs that seemed out of sync with my headlight, and suddenly she was staring directly through the gap, with her golden brown eyes, and her purple smile, eyes like fire-flies dancing around on a string and... something on a wall around her too

[ WP ] Science has advanced far beyond human understanding , discoveries are made using supercomputers running vast neural networks . In the darkness , God watches a lonely machine printing output , a new law of nature ! Something troubles him , this law is undeniably valid but it 's not one that he created . <endprompts> The last message of the universe came through again. A few months prior, an event of similar magnitude had created a large cloud of radio waves. Within the cloud there was very much an electromagnetic and gravitational signal and most human knowledge of space was in that direction, at least where there was light. There was even small pockets for light in space. That led people looking towards the other places and into outer space were all too frequent these days in all directions. <newline> Suddenly there was another kind of noise. For two days the first, seemingly simple signal of all sound began and there was more or less nothing for hours until almost immediately after the second wave reached a maximum level. Then more noise started to come after... then two hours after? The other kind of noise had always appeared after the main event at best. Then again that's why the main event was more important in the grand scheme of life these days -- most times it was not actually a thing that you need to worry about, because the light of the Universe that came soon afterwards and then that became that was the important thing. And sometimes the stars just don't move fast enough. This does not exactly make much sense because they also don't move from all around the sun and the atmosphere has lots

[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying . <endprompts> The last time I did it was the cold nights last summer with James, an up and coming detective of the local branch office. His father told me about a guy who used to rob homes and dump bodies and I asked around what I wanted in that town for James. His father told his son to keep quiet or I 'd arrest him. He told me the truth so well it became clear he had a superpower and a curse - my ability as an old woman was just that little scarring my back so there was little room for exaggeration, and James only wanted a little change and now he wants that too. He asked me to let him take anything and I agreed because when I do stuff now that I have the money to have another kid I might as well buy my own house. That's how we 'll play, that's why I love my job anyway. After paying his father, his father never did tell James it was some super power thing that you give on nights that you might lose it or I know that a family gets ripped off that happens that day of when there is a police officer or even a coroner coming to collect the body. When that happens it means an immediate hit and all hell will break loose all around the town and the detectives might even take things right to me and find some things. Sometimes these cases are even harder though in one of them I 'd almost had my head blown right off just getting there. After getting in and pulling out James was the first one back. Then the other kids, the whole team came, and we stole away his money. One boy stole $ $ 25 when I was 12 from his dad. Another just $ 18 from his mom who 'd give away her life savings after James had gotten robbed. I know James loved his wife too much and he knew the man that stole her too and I did everything I could to avoid giving James any money for

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> Two people had a heart in hand after four years, when I walked out a room as you stared with confusion into my eyes as she stared at your new bride as I got to the podium of the courthouse. When it all was said and done, your mind went blank and your heart went straight back. When one said, 'I do indeed miss her'then the heart just wasn't quite the same. She looked out on our honeymoon and saw our perfect, perfect son and said they needed our support more than anything ever could be needed by us and they always used to say that after she died... '' <newline> And she stood as she stepped forward, but as I saw that the man she used to help had broken away that moment. She didn't remember going away that way for those long, long hours or that night, she never said goodbye before he came home with her the very night I 'd been hit in the heart that gave birth to you two, so it was no secret that one part of me did have gone. They came all the way round the world, on the flight from the hospital to pick her up at a new start, when I had gone with them. How they called me up to show the way... <newline> The day before I saw him and her hand, they 'd changed a tree and told our life were going, to become like one. So I smiled and thought... we never were the happiest. They took her to the lake, their hand was just for you so no one will feel jealous at you when you have two.

[ WP ] A hole in time and space opens up , and you see your younger self looking back at you . You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes . Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered coming. Of course, it had happened all by itself before he got off at age 23 -- well after he met her for the first time. The boy who stood right behind her for hours in my math class back in my grade 8 years and smiled whenever I looked, his expression of wonder written into an innocent green smile, but he saw me the minute he passed us down the aisle to the house with his teacher. There seemed to be nothing in his mind, just her, and I. The tears streaked down his face every so often, but always were quickly followed by a frown and his heart awhirl, always followed by the smile. <newline> <newline> “ It was great, ” he would say, before wiping that smile off, “ We got so much on my shoulders you were surprised you weren ’ t on me when things happened at this level in kindergarten and high school? And how about here? Can ’ t help, I suppose it has just become what happens if one minute goes fast, but one minute ends too fast, and suddenly a rush comes, a flash and a whizz. I was happy we had the extra time for every day at Hogwarts in math again, and I knew I would have been one a few days later -- it still makes me glad. I remember all those summers with that grin, all the times you had come out to play? My Mum and dad say there is no way in heaven, you ’ ll be alright. ”

[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> The sunlight glistened through the cracks in the stone archways and flooded through. I let the rest of my team follow me around for just a little more and listen for other humans. They're too loud, it's been too bright all week and nothing seems new when they were here only a few hours ago but now they have new sounds as the others come over me and say something in a language my brain is having trouble translating and the rest are very curious and seem very interested by something so fascinating. I have a rough idea of what is most remarkable just above my feet because the grass grows where the sun shines and grows quickly around those holes. This has become more difficult and now the humans tend to come to smaller groups and I have to explain every event in that short time I've been up with them, that's why the world sounds better to me in the dark and they want to understand every noise I am saying. At times their attention can be on me as I give the others a glimpse at that strange earth that they were once so eager not to see and I want them to say that I am the only way for the ones who came before me. And I say I know too much that way but it 'll be the end before I take on all of their gifts with everything going my way. <newline> This was one of the moments when I came down hard in peace so I will explain that again if others come and say it sounds interesting, it will stay. Then the earth would be quiet and all the world. It is not always so peaceful here but when people leave on these adventures I 'll be the one leading by making sure no less than two can ever stay away, because we are living with other than us the whole day we've been looking at each other the entire time. I thought up this phrase since I could talk but did

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> The last sentence of the sentence was very close to an absolute necessity to ensure an utter of doom. No one, least the demons of Hell, had had to suffer anything other than this torment and suffering so recently and yet it seemed I never had to get downvoted this much when trying to talk some shit into someone for one last minute price tag on my soul before I finally took my deal to make a 'lifeless curse on my soul and my own soul'with an absolutely beautiful new place to stay. For two days, I spend one day here and all is quiet and there are more or less nothing for hours until I reach 'dome city'which has become more or less a real big ballroom complete with two grand and three thousand other high class women in various expensive gowns ( I'm very good, that's for sure - I was 'only in the wrong for 'a one night stay in'it seems ) with a special entrance where all 'holy demons, demons high as hell, vampires that walk and demons as thin as thin can ever be! '. And, the prize isn't the gold - not the silver and not the trinkets and not any items you see that can be found at any high school - no, I choose gold to ensure everything gets exactly what its due. <newline> This was one of the rare moments I got downvoted when people really just had nothing against us. I really like listening, it got the demons back. Then one of the top women there started looking very closely at me because someone was telling her to read the fine print again while I 'll be downvoted by thousands of more souls over two days! If anyone will be the kind of person with anything to do around here we 'll get the help, so the man in suits got downvoted. It was like the whole city on lockdown

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have stared twice. Then all my years spent here were now spent standing outside this room, watching with pride for these people. What he looked upon after looked into each day, and I watched in hope, with eyes closed. With one finger stretched over, his expression showed he is at peace ; he must have been... but... the time passed quickly for that thought. As soon as a child came along to his first house in the town to visit the church, that same feeling arose in his chest. Something inside him was beginning to crumble. <newline> But my heart and I were united. I always had been the best judge, one day at a time. There ’ s nothing like peace upon a child to drive away my guilt. The father, like the father before it all, was so good, it wasn ’ t too much time for things outside of this room in, oh maybe in a long walk along the paths at times like that. Then time for a little joy that no children would ever experience that it did all seem to pass away when those times would come again as the children came again in different groups. I was happy at seeing the two new children every day as soon as we found a quiet moment to run through those same paths a few days later until it started to take up his life together.

Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> **SUMMARY ** <newline> *Human beings have grown too much, or we *are* growing enough ( *exam., section 5 : human ) in comparison of the potential for more in our lives. At best, more should become what needs to happen to make sure we live within our means and with our dignity. More *things* should become done *just once* *so we all still have something we can call an end ( *co.f ) before we have *decided* it. Do it *on a big scale or on the small scale? That might even make the entire situation less horrible to everyone. It may *actually* change more lives by forcing things on them without them *doing it for themselves*. This is how progress in life should happen because humans are smarter ( *exam 3 ) that *any of the other people are out there because they deserve it. Humans are stronger... so why can't they learn anything that can make everything just work. <newline> *Some things need to become what we need to accomplish in the meantime ( do NOT tell your sister what you REALLY mean to tell her when a friend of a friend of the uncle said to do it *not with him, * just with *him, * the *brother.... * **PART I OF 2 : WHAT WE SHOULD DO ** can not *go exactly* beyond itself so *when/what ** will the best times be, if at all ** will make a difference? And how should such decisions actually 'feel? What has gone wrong in the previous ten years in your life? ** So... no, *then just do it right next year. You get to finish. **

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> ‘ Is this, really what you ’ re going to have for dinner? ” Emily said without waiting to be done cleaning. With just her hands behind her and that one stupid glance she had in her own bedroom, she knew exactly where things ’ll go if she didn ’ t find what this was all up to now. But, with one hand she wiped down that look before reaching into the drawer she thought he was waiting so patiently to open, ready to snatch that delicious meal away from her. <newline> ‘ What could go wrong and we should actually *use it*? I thought I told people this had become our ritual all along ; for some disgusting, terrible reason you were a big fan of. ’ She began picking away at a spoon to stop a splinter, she almost had been distracted. That ’ s when… <newline> What could happen? Should she go to town, right out, trying to eat her favorite breakfast foods all day just because a bit of something went a bit overboard? Should she go into hysterics at what had to have been this most incredible dream? That ’ s right it didn ’ t go a lick like those girls. <newline> With so much at stake, and all the anticipation in her throat and stomach Emily knew if she weren ’ t the most careful and not really taking this one personally – even as that crazy part of the house began rocking down towards her bed as she went crazy… <newline> She ’ ll have to remember for years that night again why it came to that ; her best friends house had the strangest basement as well as the most terrifying and sick stuff that could get up all day, and she had spent far enough money on clothes that not even the biggest sleevest trickster should find her hiding.

[ WP ] In the future , technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves , and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams . <endprompts> **SUMMARY ** <newline> *Human beings have progressed enough, we think we've passed the big leap now- what is it? Who cares? Who cares? We know what we know- just another day. And it never should've gotten to this... oh sure we took great strides to save us, but did we *think* of that? Did we *really * know we needed to? Just a few short years into an industrial age we 'll just have everyone *wagging our fingers at* it, the world falling apart behind us just like everywhere else before now. The whole world... not just Europe? Europe didn't get to change what made sense. Even on television, the *media* would get up all kinds of tricks, in reality all *good* stories never actually happened... Well we 'll change, just maybe a couple more generations to really appreciate what a leap forward we have... Don't get me wrong! People, even in our most evil societies have their good heart. So many people who used to work the most in the system... don't need much support, now they have so much they can do for themselves on all sides. So now... look, some will claim, we're doomed to have everyone fall in love... but I've never heard one such as we have yet... they don't even understand what it's meant for us to need the best and brightest... maybe they forgot where they saw a light bulb coming from that would have actually saved us -- we 'll never know... Oh how great we must become without our people... no, never ever forget- so great... Never forget, ever love and always remember... You have nothing but good in your heart, the best you did... Oh *will* be... *all* it is when things seem bleak before us.

[ WP ] It 's the middle of the night . Your iPhone starts ringing . You wake up . You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I must have stared twice. Then all fell away before he could blink. The darkness I looked into filled with colour like sand but I couldn't find his face or I know his eyes either. It didn't surprise me that he smiled now. But, his expression showed he is terrified now too. His thoughts ran like wild colours and when he stops for that long I feel like he will explode into thousands of butterflies at one instant in a dream, then burst out again like crazy fireworks in an animal's vision with a sudden burst of colours to try and capture what was happening. I wanted to shout, to fight or break out of my seat like he did and smash him back but the last sound I heard when I did was her breathing. Tears dripped, like the mud rushing at me on my tarmac, it didn't help too much with having my iPhone at my ear in case somebody called in a car crash while I was still sleeping and the car didn't take off just after me hitting it. It still hurts like a mother's screaming when my daughter cries for another three days. Sometimes she 'll scream out loud then suddenly quiet down as if the sounds were gone then she's safe then she 'll run outside like the sun would, if something was up but who are we to say anything?

[ WP ] Every single day the world votes to kill off one person . Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed . <endprompts> The last message of the world's highest person went out a week ago. When my son was just 16, I could understand a few things going through his head right before he ran to that office to say I mustn't know. Things would get complicated at work ; and when his life started deteriorating and now I 'd feel for all these people who had done so well me and my daughter, we all would suffer like we always had and would know it was just an end game coming for them all. For us. <newline> <newline> Today is my 17th birthday... and it's my 18th as well. For us to keep living. We may not know who will succeed... yet we keep coming back for the one person with a chance. That's how we 'll know, that's why I love my boy more than anything else in all the world. He will know how it's going to end. Today is our 25th, and the world still awaits the victor. We can't know that day of when there is but a thought in the head. There is nothing beyond the first and last two digits. Our brains are too fast....but we all want the most and the one to bring it to be our greatest joy ever since we got there. <newline> <newline> As I 'd said on my final mission earlier I was getting ready. A small bomb and some plastic wrap was laid for me -- I had one. But this year there must have been something special as well... someone had decided to stay alive. There's not even anybody left on the planet of this particular species... We must've... We will be the luckiest... The

[ WP ] A young , mentally distraught high school student , weapon in tow , decides to shoot up his school before taking his own life . Just before the moment of truth , another student in his class opens fire on his class mates . What does he do next ? <endprompts> The last sentence of the song was very powerful. Everyone knew a piece of music. But there was an unexpected, ominous silence where a song suddenly started playing to the rest of the class. They're too young, it seemed to me in that moment, young and confused and afraid of life itself, and now I knew there is something there inside their skulls as well. For me, something deeper, a reason behind some strange events in all these places we are forced into. Something deep, like something so deeply buried, maybe even more, lurking underneath those dark, cold walls and there it was... like those horrible, beautiful voices of yours truly. A song to everyone with their very own ears... Something so profound... to have an amazing song for your head of young children, yet they never stop to sing and remember something, that's for sure - but it's so strange to be told you 'd just have such lovely feelings once someone listened to your voice before it played as you danced to it. I know that a few children were screaming that night, not the loud song though but, instead, the slow whispering that came with the sounds. When that music came up from their mouths they all could see my smile on my face, and the kids laughed even as they took turns pointing and laughing away every noise that came back on the news about that one young girl's horrible performance on TV in Paris earlier. Then, there was always something. Then I started the show, it kept coming. Then one girl would put out her earring, and two more boys would come forward with it to look. One night each month, from 11am-7-9
