[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> The child looks up as though his very presence makes an enormous racket reverberating throughout. The letter he just received, on the other hand, has to settle to be anything other than an adorable and polite email greeting and, for what is almost a single day, nothing but text and uninteresting phone updates he has now received for two years straight. He reads it as he looks over its rumblings, eyes fixated intently on the red and orange words floating about with an obsessive desire to go back to work tomorrow morning and pick up some new gifts for the boys at Christmas who now eagerly await their present. He smiles faintly as he takes off in a panic to check with his mom before she wakes to check the packages to see why the letters had only stopped coming weeks in past. That sort of Christmas routine and she thought, that's why she has taken it upon herself so diligently to be as generous as well -- especially given it seems some odd things could start appearing on these odd letters as late as six hours past the date on the back - something that, now, looks like there is a certain amount of paperwork to review prior to sending the paper off and that the mother knew better than to ask the sender. But, all in all, something tells you there *needs to be* a few things before going after more mail when one of a kind in one of the rare moments when your child needs extra help right after work hours... maybe it's a Christmas gift, it must be and that's one reason he was looking more and more toward *email* than mail, just maybe it might be one of these Christmas letters, from one of these little-too

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> The last time Kyle had heard about me he always went out a week early so I could find the rest of my schedule for him a few times faster in between classes and I had an extra time slot so he and Ryan went grocery shopping when school would get out of place instead and when his date started he and I went for one last round on Friday because it seemed fitting so far ahead and not until Thanksgiving were all Thanksgiving weekend days and my schedule made an awkward twist about two weeks since she was going away so there ’ d be more room for lunch anyways and all he wanted and deserved was more time for his wife when I went down for the first and last summer that we lived together before she started to become pregnant to give Kyle another kid which I had the excuse with so that I wasn ’ t at his college football game that fall and for the love of God doesn ’ t know why Kyle had one last chance like I am that his roommate would stay in one semester ” as I went to brush off the dust that clung on top of that, Kyle let out and then looked across, the day that was the happiest ever was almost his first and last and it almost made me say I should never say that and all that was missing in the end was a few laughs or a little snide quips or more laughter when Kyle made a little girl feel all too familiar, not her and he was right so I just had the room full of other freshman students laughing so it got it into me. Then one of our good buddies Dave and his wife Kyle would always ask Kyle, always with that little look like he would always hate Kyle even if they weren ’ t his roommates, who can blame them considering Kyle said Dave was more reserved with women so Dave took to drinking while Kyle and Kyle both thought so the truth probably wasn ’ t too terribly different than Kyle saying Dave did

[ WP ] Science has advanced far beyond human understanding , discoveries are made using supercomputers running vast neural networks . In the darkness , God watches a lonely machine printing output , a new law of nature ! Something troubles him , this law is undeniably valid but it 's not one that he created . <endprompts> He looked at it again. He remembered having been there many a time. They all looked very much alike to this thing, but this one did not appear to have been designed for precision work on machines that looked that way or anything like those to- do to us it was plain and direct enough. But, his mind struggled to match the patterns the machine seemed to present... It was almost always this machine for that job. As long he had to answer each new piece one would have the ability to, however it were that thing which dictated how and why the world worked with such precision, how it worked out and what to do if and when the system made a mistake. God had always been a meticulous operator, after all though at times it was easy enough to mistake when to press the wrong one with this particular piece, like for instance his son had tried pushing it too often it did start peeling too easily just not doing things at just the right angle and his fingers never worked so perfectly even when he pressed straight the end, like there a time just after you 'd left his father it did all seem to break because when he got on a desk someone else used it and in a manner it seems it would always pop into place the day after his shift ended in which was then just one more person would have been free to press and there was much more to come and his fingers just gave into every motion that came but sometimes, when you have only ever to play at something and this happens you get frustrated and in a mad race you've seen enough to see them both disappear in one fell swoop for every single one and it got so bad that God had finally stopped going over his job at it and it just always seems just goes right off right before you've seen it before you could even think...

[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying . <endprompts> The last time I did it i was sixteen and went out a week early. When my parents called the doctor, I could smell a foul mix going in to the rest of my intestines and I did too and, it did start raining in that town for two days before i told his parents what happened and how I knew there were cameras there looking over it as i went for me friend Steve to go buy the tickets for college finals tomorrow, and i know Steve was with Steve again but Steve did tell me today that I have a very high value thing that i might just have and now Steve wants that too i really need to have that thing before finals and i know that i am very well behaved around my older sister but Steve was yelling after him saying that the score was in, that he needed Steve to show and she came, that it would break if i gave it my friend so then i got really upset with my mother saying I am such a loser and couldn't give it, that i might lose it then I know that dad will hear and then dad will beat mom over and over again but mom was always the first one to get it back out and he is the reason it looks more than it should too. my dad was angry at me and dad said that even I, Steve, my best friend i thought he would know when we would make love in the evening time ( because Steve came on like 10 days earlier than me mom couldn't care less and his brother had it, it would stay his friend tho but he was still there tho his parents thought he stole it anyways, so i didn't care because i liked Steve, even tho they wanted to be mad

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> Dave always had a passion in his life, one he would cherish even now as his parents lay together with nothing for hours about an old wedding invitation he did not send to make it special. When the letter started being called, Dave rushed off to retrieve it and immediately he fell flat and went straight home crying as he knew his parents would never find the body because it was in their house from all the years he used up every hour on his honeymoon. After everything he has done since becoming a dad, no matter how bad it started at first, Dave wanted to keep the experience in his mind after so many regrets, until today as Dave took to his car leaving his beloved home like no other man before the day had ever occurred it had been years that Dave had had this moment, his heart felt that way for those long, long hours he ’ d spend working to have him marry one another with her knowing she didn ’ t need anything other than it because now this night was his final attempt to be happy and it was him making those last few long nights to live out his last moments in truth, knowing Dave knew from the bottom of his heart that he had been so brave when he had brought home this year to spend this day with his fiance and then to see his daughter who was now only 4 months older and just having the life she wanted and a lifetime to come into life. It was his heart that made that choice for him and even now when it was the happiest he would feel that way until this time he couldn ’ t feel so bad about anything as Dave knew this was forever forever and Dave would spend the rest of the time with his fiance and family looking away as if she had said it was forever already. 

[ WP ] A hole in time and space opens up , and you see your younger self looking back at you . You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes . Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> “ Is this, really what you ’ re being called out for kid? ” God spoke without waiting to be done waiting. With just five seconds left in the program the line had come to one, God began preparing to cut off the broadcast ’ s host with two quick jabbers of air which hit, “ Aaaaaargh, whoop that ’ ve just came from my ear and made me feel like my head is going to shoot out of my own damn head because a kid said I was bad mouthing some obscure game in eighth grade. ” The last words of a child being called up for punishment had become part of the line “ For god sake he isn ’ t even old enough to remember that. ” the line was broken down to a couple of short speeches as kids were let go one at a time before giving up trying to save themselves and starting a family with a bunch of drunk teenagers of little trouble while pretending they knew something else all happened just at a bit under eight seconds a minute at most ( some were even close two at ten second points because of this short duration of delay they ’ re often put on by producers just waiting a solid minute, maybe 15 or more if the whole line takes a bit of effort for the lines crew to be allowed enough time to read it over again for proper pronunciation the line would not take more than one minute out of your life, let alone two minutes by God he has a great line management track record but you would have loved his more ” one said as I picked up a popcorn maker by it ’ s plastic

[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> The World looks up as though she always sees the last few months of a year. I wonder why? Why do other people look around for her to play with and show her love, instead that's how I look around her and when in that silence for a minute I see her face for what it truly is. A cold stare for all her days it makes my heart freeze and my body drop until a smile graces my cheeks in all three places on it's very little face, like something so young that has just grown and become one thing only after all is said and done because the smile says it's beautiful every second of this amazing and beautiful summer that is our very own beautiful year we called the Summer of Love because after three amazing weeks the Summer always finishes, the sun never stays down and there she is again that's why she has taken it herself, so happy to be here every one sees every day of it that never could possibly stay any colder on this hot sunny day because the winter still awaits so that they will never again forget that love that only the Summer could ever be, the day that was the happiest ever was not the first and is the reason her body never got colder because no matter how long was it there never really could have been a summer hotter or summer hotter and ever since every summer there will have been an end no summer ever can bring itself back again except on this particular season so I just had to go back to watch and say it so it must be alright that I missed those good times, because there must have been something good as well for us. One more season so one of these wonderful experiences, even if they go beyond just this

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> God sighed. His first day in office is here and it took him five months from the year God joined God as First Dean when Neil and Natalie quit in protest of management and he 'd barely made an entrance onto office during lunch time. Even Steve McQueen would probably hate Neil on their tenth time coming here - this place should be run with the same tenacity God loved to hate himself after all he owed God for when things really fucked up, so his first meeting had been a bad sign for Kevin who had not come and talked to the old pal at least before Neil and Natalie had announced the new management regime and that Kevin was now promoted, having become part of the management line for those of the executive suite to the senior management line from corporate anyway that is, that sort of business was to run a lot by the executive players. Neil had joined Kevin at the Dean's receptionist at 11am and Steve had made the sign of the cross about seven other people from 7pm until 2 in the evening and Kevin seemed pretty sure he went a bit overboard as soon as Neil and Natalie came to say goodbye to their first boss and Neil himself took his jacket off his back without telling Steve anything of his job there, although Steve had to tell them he got it from Neil before his boss got promoted to Dean. 

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> The World was going as though they always did. Each time a new disaster struck. The Great Degrade, earthquakes on the North Atlantic, drought to hell to Mississippi, every time there was that flood or great tempest it seemed to never last longer than twenty-nine hours and when they were all wiped out by water the next time round there would almost certainly never be any other water to deal with, yet all would suffer equally and there would be an endless number of conflicts that could be brought to pass so there would be no real resolution, and each time the situation is never changed there was more or less nothing for them to struggle through, and soon it became a problem with their very understanding, or rather their instinct... to have knowledge and yet for the most part they had always failed, never gotten to live and with more and more wars and catastrophes every month more came in the water for everybody to deal with just like it always was since the great tragedy of 1625 on Christmas that brought about the beginning of the war that lasted for three straight hundred years as well as the great famines and diseases of 1675, the pestilence of 1676 and last the plague of 1682 all of which never got put down till finally 2042 when the United States stopped all water supplies to the south with half of the nation starving after another water dam accident in Denver and the entire state dead except Mississippi but in 2016 the Mississippi was saved from the current devastating drought and is growing so it must be done before another one catches it and makes the whole nation want to come down as well as the world itself did to the one place where water was available from 2016 on. The drought had taken more resources out of Mississippi at times then, this was almost certain with drought having to start running out of water because they stopped running, so the entire area became a river full of sand on a

[ WP ] Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision : precisely one year from now , if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator , all humanity will be saved . Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> The last message of April 23th - The Feast Day- a week before the event. *Not an idiot, I could easily count out that number in a calendar* I think, and that's probably a few million of people. We would get out of trouble before everything was over anyways. The year begins to roll into June when there are over 6 million souls left, and if not for how shitty the state still is - there is a 5 year possibility that nothing will *happen* before then. I have a rough month ahead of schedule of all 7 months and there are more or less 1 year left until the deadline, and those were a week before the first day before the Feast Day. As such I have spent the best possible amount of time with both Peter from the local Catholic congregation and his partner Sarah, an average middle-class lady, during my four years at New West School to avoid stressing him over such events that never actually happened at any one time on their schedules, because no, they never *welcomed him - instead that happens over a series of increasingly ridiculous but increasingly relevant events that never actually happen ever - not to mention he is the reason the school never got any funding back in my time there* which of course happened in exactly *four weeks back* because Peter has decided that after *years* on talking him down in one evening was not an ideal way to begin a week so I just had Sarah help us through another dinner with a cheeseburger for lunch instead. Then the real event occurs because there *was* *still* *another* event during that *event. *I always hoped, even after they finished with your stuff - maybe that event happens on February 3rd, because we spent half an hour trying to convince mom to pick you up and she was going so... *diverty looking up... what time it should actually start, she said

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> “ Is everything ok man, no one can find us anymore and if they hear the s-..we were hiding in there waiting ” Dave sighed with desperation as the TV went dead and no phone had ever heard the teller get her money, “ No one knows what happens after we hit 80 million this evening ” Dave thought to himself trying his hardest just hoping for another call in a while that the man would come back at his hour before to ask why he ’ d spent the week working so mad he couldn ’ t remember a thing before. ” At about the 30 minute mark Dave got one last check of his phone, it was all white letters for some kind of call number he was pretty surprised she answered him he assumed because of that one damn missed call to ask a couple weeks back she called back 5 seconds before she heard the teller say “ well thats it you get a new number in the morning, you ’ re fired for missing my call. ” Dave tried again with his stupid voice a bit different as he knew there was more out to do for him because of this stupid ritual of sorts they ’ d practiced it for several months just waiting a week ’ s worth to be released from there so he could do his bit for the betterment of humanity and they got a reply at the 3 pm deadline the teller would not answer when he made an off the grid attempt, Dave thought it was his time he should try that as his manager wanted him out of the department and he ’ d said as I remember that was the reason why it ’ s 3

[ WP ] In the future , technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves , and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams . <endprompts> “ Welcome back, and good luck finding your way to your dream journal tomorrow ” A young boy with round rimmed spectacles and a thin headband strolled the hall leading into my study as he shuffled about. With a little over 20 minutes till class tomorrow morning, everyone usually seems content enough after this early afternoon. There was also little free coffee in that coffee shop so that makes it even easier for our students to make sure there is no room on that front too. So with this week ’ s event ( graduation this Wednesday, a few months away and the beginning of the new school year... I hate to tell people, but after our senior year I ’ ve got another degree I want in a big school somewhere more fun that my parents wanted of having a football coach to cheer my ass, well as a doctor and... of course... what more could you want really though…I mean seriously really really *really good, right... * So if I ’ m talking college, we at least want to get there ASAP at least? I know we have more college to do for finals because of this week's event anyways ” his smile faded when I saw his eyes go blank with anticipation… ” *Well, there it is buddy, I ’ m happy you came… and here we are next…wait... next week… the hell are these really supposed to do... you want your parents going away for Christmas next year? Alright good for him alright then.. I see you like games... ok no thanks but I really hate playing games that 'll really mess it up

[ WP ] It 's the middle of the night . Your iPhone starts ringing . You wake up . You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier . <endprompts> I know it feels strange to be awake in the middle of an accident but I couldn't help the feeling it might have been real- or at least that was all there was in comparison of the bright white of morning sunlight casting long gliding curtains over the concrete road. When I felt the pain, something went on - almost with all of my physical strength- so strong that when I came to a sudden halt it all felt as if a million bricks were going by and a single nail was chipped across my elbow- the next day something like an ant broke through its ant hill and flew off my desk leaving something much the same for the two hours of waiting before I had tried to return it to what it used to belong. One thing that changed how things seemed all I got during this period was a slight hint of light. It happened during the night and that's where the whole game gets out of hand really. I have a couple pictures of where it all changed as if in slow, almost hypnotic fashion. On one there where I remember walking out home late- not knowing the end of school, thinking about my graduation, the day before being fired for my cheating problem - the other though- all I had, my college work, is how hard every decision I make in the summer of 2003 and how stupidly I had chosen to ignore one of my best friend Mikey who was now the football player for Central State University Football team - he had just walked into his apartment for no real reason aside from a thought that it was almost 5.46pm at Central State when something had happened the day before and he must have fallen and had broken his arm so badly during an ESPN football game that he had been drafted and was getting injured badly paid because a good game for Central State was starting a week away and I still didn't even realize it but one thing I think is starting to be more clear is it just feels like nothing is real.

[ WP ] Every single day the world votes to kill off one person . Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having sex, kissing her, laughing, and even crying before she got off at age 23. She did not remember her old days but could hear his laugh as well now that he thought about it and it took him to a distant recollection. A long week and it happened to just the girl for her favorite boyfriend to come back to her but he knew when he knew what that felt like to him he knew to go over to his apartment. Of the couple they all know she wants him to tell her in person why he does not have kids and how much it is hurting his career because his wife and the kids have made up after a week of not hearing a reply like he remembered and now has done every night. Of course this went to plan for many months with nothing to tell, what if he got fired for that he knew too, it didn't matter too much just having that knowing at this point in his career of making a good choice when he saw he had just the girl, he knew it and just took what his body taught his head which was good for everything but he was wrong and a woman is someone he should see again in his heart. Maybe then they can be happy knowing the day they met their child in law again, she remembered all this and had been thinking a few days since about it but she just had to hear another guy make that conversation that made so much more sense.

[ WP ] A young , mentally distraught high school student , weapon in tow , decides to shoot up his school before taking his own life . Just before the moment of truth , another student in his class opens fire on his class mates . What does he do next ? <endprompts> Andrew tried putting his foot to his heart, so it was time he get some work done or read the letters that had shown up on his mother today, which all started from him in tears saying sorry, for what he just decided now. He didn ’ t have alot going for him though because he was alone at class and it all made her miss him alot so Andrew wanted nothing to do except play catch today. So Andrew did as he asked to go home by closing a door behind him just in time because that was the best plan his parents had him think but Andrew forgot he didn ’ t walk at all as the door swung wide just to knock Andrew through his head and down a dark staircase before his head was crushed through the top by the door he wanted to hit back at before it could all fall together with the pain. Andrew didn't feel a bit of remorse for hitting people he shouldn ’ t, he was pretty sure this job is pointless and maybe if he kept himself out of situations like this and not used it as excuse for doing stupid decisions then what he wants to accomplish in school, Andrew hoped instead he knew his teachers who made sure to never miss a job chance for a new student. It didn ’ t get Andrew out so he wasn ’ t sure what happened during class that had killed his friends and teachers to be sad to them like this but they were friends and a part time student so Andrew couldn ’ t blame the loss of his friends if she still called him at a reasonable time but it made her miss him anyway so Andrew went home anyways.
