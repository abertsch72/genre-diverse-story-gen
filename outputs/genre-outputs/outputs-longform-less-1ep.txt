[ WP ] Space mining is on the rise . The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo . Write a news story covering the event . <endprompts> It was only a matter of time before they had the answers. It was inevitable. No human on Earth could escape it. A massive asteroid belt had been discovered in the heart of Africa, with a possible orbit of 300 kilometres above the surface. There was no way for the astronauts to escape. No ship could make it down, no ship could even travel further than 20,000 kilometres. The only way to stay alive would be to be completely alone, so all had turned to the private sector, and the government for help. <newline> <newline> When the first ship had made it across, they had expected a massive impact from the impact, but it was much smaller. A little less than 2 metres in diameter, barely the height of a building, they had to assume the ship had flown through space, not out. <newline> <newline> All communication was lost for several days. The government had even given up on trying to contact anyone who had been there, and all attempts to contact the first survivors had gone unanswered. <newline> <newline> Finally, the government had released some basic information on the asteroid belt. It was on a roughly circular path around the equator, with a slightly slanted orbit. No orbit in the middle of the belt, just a few orbits at most, and no clear view of the centre. It was assumed that it was a planet, like we had previously thought, but the scientists who had looked were shocked to discover that it was the largest planet we had ever seen. <newline> <newline> The government had released many new discoveries on the planet. The size of its moon was surprising. It could support a population of over 100 billion, far beyond the size of Earth. There was no life on it. <newline> <newline> The first humans had taken over the ship to try to make contact with the planet. Their ship didn't survive. The people aboard had been very lucky, and had managed to escape the asteroid belt, but there was no life on the asteroid belt, just lifeless rocks. <newline> <newline> The first mission to the planet had failed, too.

The first time he had killed a human, he had thought it was cruel. A cruel thing to be able to do to one. A cruel thing to be able to kill him. But he had felt it to be right. It had been the right thing to do. To end life in a way that would make the person happy. To be the one that would have the most pain of all. He had had it done to him before, but never since. <newline> <newline> Today, he did it again. He looked in the mirror and thought that it was wrong. It made him angry. Angry, because he had never felt anger like this before. He was a bad person, the first one to ever kill, but to do it was worse. To kill, he felt as if his own life had been taken from him, and there was nothing he could do. Nothing he could do to make the person who had done this happy, and he would have to make the other do it too. <newline> <newline> `` What is it you want?

You've already done it. '' <newline> <newline> `` I can, but I have to know. '' He said, in that deep voice, `` What is it you want? '' <newline> <newline> `` To live.

I'm already gone, and you can do as you wish. It's over. You have to move on. '' <newline> <newline> `` But you can't. '' She said, `` What's your point? '' <newline> <newline> `` If I had a gun, I 'd just put a bullet in your heart, and let you go. '' He said, in that deep voice, `` Because I can't do that. '' <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure?

'' <newline> <newline> He pulled the trigger, and she screamed. <newline> <newline> Her screams are what he feels now, that he now knows is his purpose. He pulls the trigger again, and she stops screaming. She does not even cry, or beg for help. She is still smiling, though. And that was a good thing. <newline> <newline> He is still alive.

I sat on my cot for what seemed like an eternity, staring at the wall that separated heaven from earth. It was a beautiful place to me, with all of the celestial lights, the infinite amount of people I would meet in a lifetime. However, there was something just not right with this place. At one point I would have thought the walls were beautiful, but today, I felt as though they were not worth it. All of the lights had stopped working and I couldn ’ t even tell if there was any going on over there. I had heard the stories about a place like this, where you could see the face of God and then you had to be a real person. Hell was a place that you could see God, but could not interact with Him. It was supposed to be an area of paradise, where you could experience life without feeling like a loser, but I wasn't sure this place would be able to match up. <newline> <newline> I knew I should have stayed in earth, but it seemed like a good idea.

The problem is, I just got here a minute ago. ” I glanced at him and smiled, “ Yeah, right. Don't worry, we're all here because God just sent us here. He has a big day planned, you know, one of His most important things. ” The crowd quieted down, and I looked back at the man with a sigh. “ I'm afraid this is going to have to be an eternity of waiting. If I die now, God will not send me to heaven. ” <newline> <newline> “ Oh, well, ” the man said, “ You certainly aren't the first of my kind to arrive. He will be here with you as soon as possible. In fact, he already knows the number of people who have come before you. But, he has been waiting so long, I just have to say : thank you for joining me. ” The crowd was silent, but the man continued, “ This is the place where we are going to show Him that we are really good people. ” I looked around at the people. There was a man wearing a white robe and a black shirt. He looked like he was about to say something, but stopped when a woman wearing black and white came and stood next to him. She was wearing long black hair that fell over her eyes. She said something that sounded like, “ Welcome to heaven. ” <newline> <newline> I sighed again, “ This isn ’ t the place I want to be, ” I said. I was beginning to regret it all. A man with black hair started to speak, “ There are others, you know, just like you. I have come here to make sure they don't die, that they get to experience life in a way that isn't so bad. ” <newline> <newline> “ What do you mean by that? ” I asked.

She said I was `` just too much of a dick for her '' and, for a second, I was. But hey, I know she loves me, so I can live with that. So here we are, a couple of weeks in, still in love and dating. I still love her, she still loves me. <newline> <newline> We get down to business. I show her the picture of the engagement ring I received last week, and she almost instantly runs. She is not the type to run like she used to, and I guess that ’ s why we had that little date at all. It was like a slow crawl, and a slow crawl that never ended. <newline> <newline> We had our first child, and I was the one who raised him. But she loved him more than anything else, and I was in love with him, and the other woman. But we were never together in real life, so we hadn't had real relationships, but in the same dream. <newline> <newline> The baby, named for my wife ’ s favorite star and a friend of mine, came out last month. And I had to see his birth before she could join us on our trip to Germany to see the fireworks in a park and to play pretend. I was so happy to see him. It was like she could have him, she was just an old woman with old problems, and she was happy to see the baby grow. <newline> <newline> “ So how does it feel knowing she was the only thing that got in the way of my happiness, ” I asked her, in a tone that was barely audible above the chatter of our children on our floor. <newline> <newline> She looked at me for a moment, then turned and ran off into the kitchen, laughing a little. <newline> <newline> I don ’ t know why, but I felt something for her. <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> I woke up to the sound of my wife laughing in the kitchen. I did not open my eyes until she was gone. I went to the bathroom and got dressed and went to the shower. I checked the clock on my phone. It was 6:40 in the morning. I looked down at the baby ’ s name tag. I noticed that the baby ’ s name tag was attached to his wrist. <newline> <newline> I turned around and there she was. I was confused. <newline> <newline> Her name tag was all over her wrists. The only reason she had her name tag was to be the wife of the person who raised her. And I had been running from the love of my life all this time. So when she gave me her name tag, I was so shocked. <newline> <newline> I ran down the stairs, yelling at my wife, but my shout was met with silence. I saw her holding the baby close, and she looked as if she was about to cry. I looked into her eyes, and I was so scared. <newline> <newline> “ Honey, ” I said. <newline> <newline> “ Honey, are you okay? ” she said. <newline> <newline> “ Honey, it ’ s fine, ” I said. <newline> <newline> I took off down the stairs, trying to get away, but I tripped on my own shoes. I fell down on the couch and it all happened so fast. <newline> <newline> I woke up, my baby, the one who had been waiting for me. I was so happy to see the baby grow and to see him and his mother.

And I knew I would be one day. <newline> <newline> The guards who had led me from the jail were the first to talk to me. They called me, `` Grim Reaper.

I just had no answer for them. <newline> <newline> I was left in this cell, with only my cell mates, the guards, and the God of Death. Death took off his hood, revealing what he was, and what he wasn't. I looked around the room, but no one was there. I decided to try to understand his words. `` I know that this is all a game to you. '' Death began. `` For the last 100 years, you've been playing this game for yourself. And so far, you've made a pretty good show of it. You've won so many of my battles, so many times that I've had to close down this part of the cell, and leave you alone again.

I'm just glad you're here. '' Death looked down and looked up, and suddenly, he was laughing. `` I can't help but be glad you're here. '' He walked over to me. `` It's been so long since I've laughed this hard. The last time was when I broke my neck. '' Death looked me straight in the eye, and I saw his humor. `` I wasn't laughing at that time. I was laughing at that moment, because you were the first person to laugh like that. You were the first to ever laugh like that. I think that's why I was the first person to laugh like that.

He looked down at his hands. `` When I was here, I was afraid you would be here for a long time, even though I've been here for years. I didn't want you to go anywhere, but when you finally came, I didn't have to put up with it anymore. I saw your humanity, the way you smiled, the way you laughed at the world and laughed at me. '' He stood up and walked over to me, where I saw a small book I recognized as the Grim Reaper's personal journal. `` I wasn't sure what to think when you first started doing this, but you taught me how to accept it, how to feel happy. You told me I would have to wait to see the Grim Reaper come to me. When you finally did, it was because you thought I was ready. '' <newline> <newline> `` I am.

Mr. Wilson had been working in the factory for six months now, making his way through the fields of potatoes to the front of the car. He was tall and lithe, with dark hair and thick glasses.

The human's seemed so grateful that they had been spared, the machine people hadn't expected the human's to die so suddenly. The human had never told the humans their full name, just that he was known as the Human, the name of his machine people. <newline> <newline> He was given a small place in the city, where he could watch over the machines and their machines. In return, the humans would be allowed to live in peace, since the humans were the only ones allowed in the city. This meant that they were in a position to kill him if need be, the humans had only attacked him to try and kill his people, the machine people had been forced to protect their civilians and keep the peace in the city. <newline> <newline> In fact, the machine people were so thankful for this, they were even happy that it had become the last thing they had to do, they had decided not to fight to the death as they had originally planned. <newline> <newline> He watched in wonder as the humans, some more physically strong than others, and the machines were gathered in a circle, with the machine people all looking at one another and smiling, they were so happy, and they were the ones he had been sent to protect. <newline> <newline> Suddenly, a machine soldier came in, with a machine gun in one hand and a machine pistol in the other. He smiled at the machine soldier, and laughed. `` They are so lucky to have the Humans here.

I just needed to. <newline> <newline> I began looking for ways to change this new life, but for every change I made I would find myself unable to get back on my feet in the same way I had in the old life. It wasn't until one day that it occurred to me, I couldn't die. <newline> <newline> This was something that had been on my mind since I had started moving on with my life. It had been a hard realization to make at the time, but then again, it was a hard realization to have for me. <newline> <newline> The ghost had gone. <newline> <newline> That was until my phone rang.

I thought he would be here more, when he was sleeping. '' <newline> <newline> `` That's what I thought too, but it's the truth. '' <newline> <newline> `` Then why do you don't like it when I go to bed? '' <newline> <newline> `` It's just not that fun anymore. '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh well, maybe I should just live without him? That's the best thing that will happen to me. '' <newline> <newline> `` What about him? I think he might like it. '' <newline> <newline> `` That's what I thought too too, but it's the truth. '' <newline> <newline> `` How? '' <newline> <newline> `` You see, you see, it's pretty complicated. He's my best friend, he's so sweet, I don't even know what to say. He comes to me when I'm bored and I feel sorry for him, he goes away after some time, but whenever he does come back he's always just as good as he was the first time.

Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> He was only 21 when he first woke up. He hadn't been in a long period of time - at least, not for him. Still, there was no time. The world had moved on, the humans had moved on, and all he had to do was wait and see how long he would have to wait. It hadn't taken long to realize the only thing he would have to wait for was that his vision would come true. <newline> <newline> He had been living in a home - a modestly-equipped place with no real furniture, and not much in the way of amenities. His eyes had been trained, though. A simple white light on the front door, a little door with a door handle, and a little white mirror on the bed. The light was enough, he reasoned. <newline> <newline> He was alone now - no kids, no wife, no pets, just him and the room that served as his shelter for the last year. He 'd been alone for a little while, and it was a strange feeling. He hadn't been alone for long enough. He felt alone. <newline> <newline> Suddenly, he heard a voice behind him. He spun around, and there was a man in a black suit, looking at him in the mirror. He was a handsome man, and he wore a dark suit. He smiled at him, the man was smiling back. <newline> <newline> `` Welcome back. '' He smiled, `` I should have told you that.

'' <newline> <newline> `` You see, if there was any chance of a world to live in, I would have told you about me, but that would have been the same as living in a world without a future. '' <newline> <newline> `` How could I live in a world without a future? '' <newline> <newline> `` Because every single human that still lives in a world would be killed.

He was also in the house and now on the floor, he was not sure if he was awake or not. <newline> <newline> He began to scream and he was scared. He wanted to cry and he couldn't. There was nothing around him that he could call a pillow or a pillow. He sat up and stood up again, but before he did, he remembered something. He remembered a book. The book was something he had seen his father give to him. He had seen the picture of the book sitting on a shelf in his room. He remembered the words, <newline> <newline> *Don't make a mess, <newline> Don't look out the window, <newline> Don't do anything stupid. <newline> <newline> Don't do anything stupid. <newline> <newline> You will make a mess. *

Except we haven't had any of those years. <newline> <newline> People have always been asking why. The answer is simple, really : `` They don't want to die ''. No, we know, they want to die, but we just can't give them what they want. If we give them what they want, then we can't give them the truth that they want. <newline> <newline> That's why, every year, the world votes for one person to be killed. Not because they want to, not because of some twisted wish, but because they have a right. Everyone has a right to vote. They have a right to have their beliefs expressed. They have a right to have their desires fulfilled. That's the way this system works. <newline> <newline> The first person to die was John Wick. A former spy, a brilliant assassin who was also a killer. He was given a new name, and the world was shocked. The assassin John Wick had been voted by the entire world. The next person to die was the most evil person in history, Vladimir Putin. It was announced that Vladimir was the most evil person in history, and no one would dare to kill him. <newline> <newline> The world was in shock. But now John Wick was voted the greatest person in history, and the most evil person in history. He killed every single person that John Wick had ever done a horrible thing to, including Vladimir. The only people who survived were John Wick, Vladimir Putin, and everyone else who had the most power. <newline> <newline> It was a massacre. Everyone in the world died in what was known as the Black Death. But it didn't matter. The most evil person in history, Vladimir Putin, had been voted the most evil person in history, and the most evil person in history died in his most evil act. <newline> <newline> That was the day John Wick was voted the most evil person in history, and the most evil person in history died. He was the first murderer in history.

The way he carried himself and talked in class was always a mess. He seemed to constantly make remarks about himself and his friends, which always made me feel like I had lost him. It made me feel like there was no one here for me, no one who cared about me. I had no one left. <newline> <newline> This was his way of trying to get away.

If only it had been possible to go somewhere like this instead of in one of those dingy backwater camps. That sounds so cliche. It would have been a lot easier to just leave. No one really knows why they are here, why they were even chosen to be chosen. The first time I had seen one of them was back in the beginning, just before the storm. They were all sitting around one of those old looking devices they keep talking about. They were all laughing at my expense and they were going on about how much better it was than the old days. It looked like a big floppy disk. It was the last thing I was going to buy but I was happy that they had shown it to me. That's the only good thing about these things. It could be just as important as the old ones, or it could be the other way around. I just wanted to get to work, I wanted to have a good day. The little blue box wasn't very tall so I had to crawl over to it, but I managed to get myself up to it and open it. I put a button on it, nothing fancy. Just a little thing that said `` Start '' on a white screen. It wasn't much of a button to begin with. I hit the big button on the top, and the little blue box started blinking at me. I couldn't see what was inside of it but the screen just said `` START '', and then `` START '', and then `` START ''. <newline> <newline> As I was typing, my hand felt something hard smack into my cheek, and my vision went black.

'' <newline> <newline> The other guy just chuckled and walked away. The people looked confused, as if someone had just been told not to say `` start ''. <newline> <newline> I tried to turn back around, but I couldn't. Something had stuck in my throat and I couldn't stop thinking about that damn blue box. I looked down, and a black-clad man was sitting at the top of my bunk. `` Don't even try to get up, '' he said. <newline> <newline> I turned around again and sat up. The other guy had taken one look at me and left. I could hear a woman sobbing somewhere in the distance, and I was starting to feel woozy. When I opened my eyes, I saw that I was in an old factory that looked oddly familiar. <newline> <newline> `` Where's the rest of my family? '' I yelled, trying to get up. <newline> <newline> A young man in a white lab coat came up to me. `` Yes sir, your father was killed last year and his body was found two days later.

They told him about how the big black van pulled into a driveway on a cold winter morning, and the parents got out and walked in. It had a family name on it, but the kid couldn't remember the name of the person in the van. He was just afraid. <newline> <newline> And so was everyone else, for that is what people do. They get scared and afraid, but they forget about it later. <newline> <newline> That's what happened to my dad. It wasn't the first time he died, and he never would be. But it was the first time it was for a young child. He was sitting on a bench on the sidewalk, wearing some kind of uniform. When the kid stepped onto the sidewalk, he wasn't afraid. He was in a nice suit. There was an address on it. That address was his house. It wasn't his house. But it was his house. <newline> <newline> The kid jumped out of the van. `` Hey, kid! '' he shouted. `` Stop that! '' <newline> <newline> The kid stood there. It wasn't his house. It was a place that belonged to someone else. He looked around, and in his mind there was another way he could get to the address. He knew that the address was his own. He had seen the address on the newspaper and he remembered seeing it before. He went to the address on the front of the newspaper. `` That's my house, '' he said, again. <newline> <newline> The kid wasn't afraid. <newline> <newline> When he got to the address, it wasn't the house. <newline> <newline> The house was where his dad had died. It was a long, straight corridor with a big door that wasn't there when he first arrived. He went to the door, and pushed the door open. <newline> <newline> He saw what looked like a person. <newline> <newline> He didn't see a ghost. <newline> <newline> `` Hey, kid! '' the ghost yelled. He was tall, and he had a bushy tail and a big white beard. He looked in the mirror and saw the ghost of his dad sitting on a bench. It was a big, fat ghost, but there were no children playing in the playground. <newline> <newline>

[ WP ] Write a better ending to the `` Russian Sleep Experiment '' Creepypasta . <endprompts> So. This is where I decide to start. It was an old school school science experiment for science kids, or so I've been told. It started back in the 70s, back in the 80s. One by one, scientists were trying to figure out how to induce sleep. They were able to do it for awhile, but eventually things started to get out of hand. <newline> <newline> First, we tried to sleep through an alarm, but then we tried to sleep through a movie. No dice. The first time I tried to go into the bathroom, the door had a lock, and then we tried it on our bedroom. Once again, a no good luck, because the door was locked and the room was pitch black. We tried a second time, but the door was still locked. We tried another time, then our dog ran into the room, and we realized that the dog hadn't yet been able to sleep in the dark, so we tried sleeping with the dog. The dog was still asleep. <newline> <newline> Now, I'm not a good liar, so I'm not telling you how the experiment ended up being. All I'm telling you is that it didn't end well. <newline> <newline> There were six of us. I was the first to attempt it. It took seven days. It was the last time I would sleep through the alarm. We woke up the next day. The next week. The next month. The next year. <newline> <newline> But there was another thing that got in the way of my plan. <newline> <newline> We were the first in the world to be genetically engineered to be able to sleep. No one else was, so when the government tried to kill us, they turned to us. They thought we would make a useful lab rat, testing their new drugs on people. Instead, they found that we were the key to humanity's future. We weren't really smart, but we did what the government wanted, because they wanted us to be the best. We got some cool stuff going, like being able to learn with our eyes open, and being able to talk when we needed to. <newline> <newline> I was the first to be able to sleep in the dark. I'm the first in the world. I'm the first in the world to do anything, and I'm the first to know what it's like to not be able to sleep. It was almost like the world had come out of nowhere, and we were all the only ones left. <newline> <newline> I guess that's all that matters. I'm the only one left now, because I can't control the lights anymore. I don't have the strength to control myself anymore. I'm just a part of the world, and I just hope that by day, I can have more control over my life.

[ WP ] It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident . <endprompts> It's so very much like when I first started out. The air was thin, my lungs cramped, I was tired, my skin felt like cotton, and it was hot. I tried talking to the lady behind the counter for a change of clothes, but nobody was listening to me. I was sweating, the heat like an acid that had entered my skin, and the sun burned me with it. I couldn't see, but I knew I was alone, and my skin felt like a blanket. I didn't have any food on me anymore, so I began to take what I could, and when the air became dry, I looked around at the other workers. It was the last day, and I was tired of the sun. <newline> <newline> I decided to look outside. The sun shone brightly over the ocean, shining bright enough to make the wind blow against my face, the water so salty that I could taste it in my mouth, but not enough to get me excited. The temperature was still quite high, but not so high that it was unbearable, or so low that it was unbearable. I was at the point where I didn't care about food, and I had to be at the point where I didn't care about sleep. I went outside, and a storm of wind hit me. I hit the ground hard, and the sand was rough. I tried to crawl back up to the counter, but something caught my arm. I looked at my arm, and it was covered in something hard, like something hard and tough. It was black and white, like the sky, but in a black and white color. <newline> <newline> I felt the wind whip against my arm again, and I fell down on the ground. The pain was excruciating, and I felt like I would faint. I tried to crawl back up, but it was a slippery slope. The pain was so strong that I almost passed out. I looked around, and there was no one. I tried to call out to anyone, but I wasn't able to get anywhere. I felt like I was going to faint, and I thought about going back to the counter. I tried to get up, but the pain was so strong that I couldn't move. I reached down, and I grabbed a stick that was lying on the counter. I took one last look at the sun and the sky, and I went home. <newline> <newline> I woke up to a loud crack, and the sun had disappeared. <newline> <newline> I woke up in a cold sweat, and it was much colder than I expected. I began to sweat even harder, and I fell back down to the ground. I sat up, and the sky was filled with a bright, blinding light. <newline> <newline> It wasn't bright, it was dark. The sun was gone. I crawled over to the wall, but I saw no wall. There was only the ground. The ground had no walls, no floor. It was the sky, and there was no sky. <newline> <newline> I sat down, and tried to move my arm. It felt like it was being pulled off, and I couldn't feel it. I tried to push my arm, but it wasn't strong enough. I started to get up, and I saw a woman holding a knife. She was standing in the way of me, and she was screaming. I moved to her and I stabbed her in the shoulder, making her bleed. She screamed, and I walked over to the woman, and I stabbed her in the throat, making her bleed. <newline> <newline> I sat down, and tried to move my arm again. It felt like it was being pulled off, and I couldn't move it. I started to get up, and I saw a woman holding a knife. She was standing in the way of me, and she was screaming.

[ WP ] Thanks to a bureaucratic error , you are now Satan . <endprompts> He was supposed to be the hero of this story. A demon from the depths of hell, with no morals, only greed. That was the only difference. <newline> <newline> But he wasn't. <newline> <newline> <newline> This wasn't how I imagined a demon. In the past I 'd imagined the demon would be a monster who lived among humans and tried to rule them. I 'd imagined they 'd have all sorts of power - power to destroy, power to corrupt, power to rule, power to murder and destroy. I thought I was so naive, I didn't know what I was up against. <newline> <newline> <newline> No, this was no demon. This was a man who had killed his wife and child in a fit of rage. This was a man who had killed his boss and daughter because he thought they were trying to take his place. This was a man who had killed his children for fun and made his family pay. <newline> <newline> <newline> So I let myself get dragged into it. I let myself be the hero, because that's what they called me anyway. <newline> <newline> <newline> I let the world go to hell for a week. My demons didn't make a move to stop me. I had more fun than they did and all the demons were happy about that. <newline> <newline> <newline> A week later I was being summoned to court. That's when my demons made their move. I stood before the judge, a huge slab of metal and flames behind him. `` You're a demon, '' he said, `` but you're not as powerful as I feared.

No. I've sent legions of demons to slaughter you. You think you are the demon of destruction? No. You are the demon of terror. You are the demon of fear. You are the demon of the unknown. You are the demon of death. You are the demon of hell. '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Oh yeah? '' I muttered, `` Then what's the point of this whole thing? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` The point is, I want you to know how much I despise you. You were my first, but you failed me, '' he spat, `` You were my only hope of salvation. You're my only hope of destroying my family. You're my only hope to go back to the people I love. '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Yeah? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Yes.

I amn't sure if I have ever experienced feeling that way. <newline> <newline> I think about her for a few more seconds.

My parents were worried that maybe something was wrong with me, and that it was impossible to go back to sleep. They were right, of course. I was too young for that.

My father, well, I never really knew how to say it. <newline> <newline> He was the first person who was ever like me. He could read, but he was also extremely clumsy. When he wasn't looking, the only thing that he could see was the bright light shining from the TV screen in the corner of the room, the TV that I couldn't really control. At first, he was terrified, but over time, I noticed something. I couldn't remember what it was that scared him. He only knew one thing. <newline> <newline> My mom. <newline> <newline> She was my greatest friend. She could always find me, in the dark, or the night, or the car with the light on, wherever I was. She always took the seat beside me, so I could sleep on her. The only time I had ever missed a day with her was on Christmas when my sister was born. She came to pick me up, and the first thing I did was call out for my parents. As I was walking to the car, I passed through the light. I felt my head start to throb. I pulled myself up, and looked at the clock. It wasn't 5:12 pm. <newline> <newline> My first thought was, `` Well, this is very strange. '' But that feeling, this feeling of complete disconnect, was replaced by dread. I had just made a decision to stay with my parents and go to the doctor, but there was nothing I could do about it. I got in the car, but when I did, I was already gone. <newline> <newline> I was so, so, so, so, so, so very different. <newline> <newline> I'm the kind of kid that doesn't want to come home. <newline> <newline> The moment my parents picked me up from the doctor's office, I was ready to call it quits. They wouldn't let me go home again, but I just couldn't let them see me anymore. I just wanted to go to sleep, and sleep.

The grim reaper had never given his entire existence to bring about his end, not when there were as many living as there were dead. That was how it had ended in the first place, with so many dead. There was no real challenge for him now, and so he continued to play. It had taken him three times before he managed to kill enough of his own kind to win the game. It had taken him a hundred years before he knew he could take a game to its death. <newline> <newline> It had always been a little harder when you were a god, he reflected, and a little harder when you were a mortal. He 'd often wondered how God had come to be. He had been the first to notice the rise of humanity, and had quickly followed it up by discovering the secret to immortality. It had taken him years to find the secret to his immortality, and years to perfect the formula. And now he had figured it out. He was in control of everything. There was no more challenge, no more challenge, only his control. Death had become a part of him, and he was still playing. <newline> <newline> He had died once, to find out how to end a game. It had been a rough game, but Death had found the answer that had kept his immortality. It was a game of Death. It was a game of Death, but Death was Death. Death had finally found his balance, the thing that had kept him alive for so long. Death was over.

The sweat that was starting to form was dry and wet. “ She just said that I was cold. ” <newline> <newline> I did not know why.

He listened to the voice and for a few moments, he saw something strange in the dark, a blackness of nothing. There was a crackle of static and the noise disappeared. <newline> <newline> He looked out at the landscape. Not a soul in sight. <newline> <newline> He began to panic, looking for the source of the sound but finding nothing. He kept walking down the hill until he noticed a faint shadow in the distance. He walked towards it and when he did, he saw the silhouette of a man standing on the edge of the hill. <newline> <newline> He stood on the edge of the hill and watched as a white sheet appeared out of the ground and wrapped around the man, enveloping him and driving him backwards into the shadows. <newline> <newline> He struggled against the being but it was no help. He fell to his knees, unable to move his head, until his vision returned. The man stood over him, looking down into his eyes. <newline> <newline> His jaw was slightly open and he was staring into nothing. His eyes glinted in the blackness, his pupils were black as night, his nose was black as ice and his mouth was black as pitch. He stood there, the man was staring back into his eyes, in disbelief, but the man was also frightened and he had to get away, away from the being. He felt himself going limp. <newline> <newline> The man lifted the black sheet from the ground. <newline> <newline> The man raised his arms and a light blue glow began to illuminate his entire body. He looked into the eyes of the man, still on the edge of the hill. <newline> <newline> The man looked at the sky and saw stars, he then looked towards the sun, his vision began to clear again and he saw the man standing in the middle of it. <newline> <newline> The man smiled and said : <newline> <newline> `` My child.

[ WP ] Since childhood you 've been told that only death awaits you outside the wall . For years you have been curious . Today is your chance . <endprompts> It's so very different from when I first heard the `` wall ''. I was still a child when I first saw it in my neighborhood, watching it come down with great trepidation in my mind. As I grew older and more accustomed to my life, I began to understand why the wall appeared so far away. I would run back to my room, grab some popcorn, and peek through the wall to my little brother's room. He was sleeping, and I would watch him as he slept. I knew it was for a good time. <newline> <newline> But, as I grew older, I began to notice other people running along the walls, looking for that same thrill in their life. I noticed the faces of people I had never seen before, people I had never known. People I had never met. People I had forgotten about. People I never met. I realized the real meaning of `` the wall '' was for them to find their calling in life. To find the one person that they knew, who had given them purpose in life. The one person that would give them purpose in the dark. <newline> <newline> But I also realized that there were only so many people who would come for me, and I never found anyone to be the right fit for me. I had to be a different kind of person. <newline> <newline> I decided that I wouldn't run the wall for long. I would learn the real meaning of `` the wall '' and find my way to it, and, by the time I had figured it out, I would have been so old that my body would be completely gone. I would be a shell, left to my own devices. I would die on my own terms, in solitude. <newline> <newline> I would die alone. <newline> <newline> The wall was ever closer, ever closer. The only people who could ever really reach it were those who had lost something important. Someone who had given me purpose. Someone who gave me purpose for the end of the world. <newline> <newline> But I didn't have that in me. I was too smart to know what the truth was.

There is no one who would believe that such a foolhardy man would ever come so far as to do it. Not the foolhardy god. And so he ran. <newline> <newline> The thief knew he was a foolhardy thief, but it wasn't because of his speed that made him the thief. He knew that speed was a curse. His eyes darted wildly, seeking anything that might give him an opening. No sooner than he had come upon the door, had he thought, did he see the thief behind it. <newline> <newline> The thief looked around, and he saw two other thieves, both with eyes on the ground, one crouching to get a glimpse at the thief and another holding up his right hand to block out the thief's view. <newline> <newline> The thief, in his slowest moment of action, did what every thief does : he pulled out his revolver. The thief didn't know how to use a gun, but he knew it had to be quick, and he knew that it was only a matter of time until he could move his hand. The thief pulled the trigger, the sound ringing all the way to the end of the hall, the thief was dead. <newline> <newline> The demon looked to the thief, and he saw the two demons of hell staring at him.

[ WP ] Jesus joins the X-MEN <endprompts> He was no saint. The Bible was full of sinners who fell from the heavenly light.

He made eye contact with a large, brown-haired man. He was wearing a big tuxedo. `` I have a message for you, Mr. President, '' he said. `` The Messiah has arrived.
