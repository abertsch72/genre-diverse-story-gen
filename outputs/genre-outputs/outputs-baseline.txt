[ WP ] Space mining is on the rise . The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo . Write a news story covering the event . <endprompts> The media frenzy of the last few weeks has been relentless. <newline> <newline> I have watched with some curiosity how people react to the event. Some people feel they must be heroes. Those who are not, who are the villains. <newline> <newline> I do not want to speculate as to how this might be happening. <newline> <newline> It happened in Texas in the middle of the night. When Exxon Valdez 2.0 hit the port side of the world, the entire continent disappeared. The news went into overdrive. <newline> <newline> I have seen many other people disappear. They either left the ship, or were too caught up in their own lives to care. <newline> <newline> I am not sure of the motives of any of them. I have not yet been to Dallas. This is just another case. <newline> <newline> As I stare out into the open, watching the spectacle unfold over the horizon, I feel the weight of my knowledge wash over me. I am a journalist and I am writing this to document some of what I have seen. <newline> <newline> I am a journalist, and I am writing this as I sit in a field with a camera, and a few people in suits around me. I have lived in this city for ten years. In my early years, I had never been in danger. I have lived in a small town with a beautiful weather-beaten sky, and a few miles from the nearest city, where the sun is a beautiful shade of green. <newline> <newline> There is no way in hell I could have known of such a thing. There has never been a single accident on any ship. The only fatalities were those on Exxon Valdez. We weren't alone. <newline> <newline> We had all heard the story, of course. The headlines read `` Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill cargo '' and `` Explosion destroys the world's largest oil tanker ''. <newline> <newline> There was absolutely no reason to believe that it would have killed any of us. A ship, a cargo vessel, a ship of oil. We were all dead. It wasn't fair that we were all to lose our lives in an accident like this. <newline> <newline> I looked around the field, and saw the same people around me. <newline> <newline> It seemed as if there was a war going on. There were no deaths, no looting. No riots. There was a good supply of supplies, and a great many people were happy. It was as if the people around us were not afraid of a war that could be won. <newline> <newline> I felt myself start to panic. I wanted to run away, but the people in the crowd were waiting for me to run away. I wanted to run away, but I knew I could not. <newline> <newline> I started to run to the cars that lined the highway. I was surrounded by people. They were all armed with guns and knives. They didn't care what I said. <newline> <newline> I started to run to the people that tried to rob me. People who looked very frightened. People who had guns and knives. They screamed, crying, crying. I started to run into them. I began to feel the fear of the people around me. I began to worry that if I ran too close, I would be shot by the people behind me. <newline> <newline> As I started to close the distance, I realized that this was not the only time that I had felt fear. I heard that the people inside were yelling in the streets. <newline> <newline> I closed my eyes, and realized that I could not move. <newline> <newline> I started to cry.

You are extremely powerful with almost no control so you find a demon that 's very weak but extremely good at controlling his powers . <endprompts> “ Well, do I have to start over? ” <newline> <newline> I looked down at my hand. It was small, and it was bound to the hand in a loose knot. It was a simple task to make, but something like that wasn ’ t easy. <newline> <newline> “ The hand! ” I tried to push myself forward, but I could feel the hand on my side. <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s alright. ” He said with a bit of a chuckle. <newline> <newline> My arm moved like a slow motion, trying to reach the hand, but was stopped by the hand. It was a small, black, metal contraption, with two hands sitting on a red button. I was surprised at how fast I could make the hand move. I didn ’ t notice. <newline> <newline> “ Well, why do we have to work here? ” I asked. <newline> <newline> “ Well, because we have to. You ’ re a Demon.

We don ’ t even know what the hand can do. ” <newline> <newline> “ No, you don ’ t. It is what we do. You are here to study the hand. You are also here to find out what it can do. ” <newline> <newline> I looked down at my hands. They were small, almost a touch too large for my size. They were metal and had the same power. <newline> <newline> “ Oh. ” I said weakly. “ Why are you here? ” <newline> <newline> “ To find out, ” he said in a soothing tone, “ I am your guardian angel. ” He held up two large, black, metal arms. <newline> <newline> “ I ’ m sorry. ” <newline> <newline> “ Then tell me. How much does it cost? ” <newline> <newline> I was confused for a moment, but I just stood there, looking down at my hands. <newline> <newline> “ Just enough to get you to start over. ” <newline> <newline> “ So… ” I asked, “ Can I try again? ” <newline> <newline> “ No, ” he said, “ You know I can not do that right now. You are the one that needs to know, ” he waved his arms with his free hand and pushed me forward. “ This is your final job. I need you to work on your power. I will be on your side when you are ready. ” <newline> <newline> I looked down at my hands and felt my eyes close. They were beautiful and full of life. <newline> <newline> “ This… This is not something I ’ m good at right now. I ’ ve just been stuck in this place for what I can barely comprehend. ” <newline> <newline> I stared at his hands and looked around my house, hoping for something to help me get here. I was so alone, so confused, that I forgot about the demon in the hand. <newline> <newline> It was now or never.

It seemed as though his usual work had been complete by the time he got back. He pulled up a sheet of paper from his desk, and started writing out his thoughts. It seemed like he had something important to write. He didn't have a lot of time left, so he went ahead and skimmed over all his notes, trying to see if he missed anything. He looked at the number three again, but this time, the number three made sense. He glanced at his computer screen, and saw that the day was nearly over. This wasn't possible. <newline> <newline> He was going to keep on reading, so he kept working on what he knew. Eventually, he began to think that he had a terrible day. He went back to his desk, and began to make the preparations. He hadn't read for another week or so, so he hadn't heard from anyone. He made sure to make sure his thoughts were in order, and checked his phone once more. This time, he knew he had no other contacts to call. He checked his contacts again. No phone calls. No texts. He started reading again, but this time, he got a message that he didn't know his name. He dialed the number of the Führer's secretary, and got a message that read, `` Good afternoon, Mr. President. I'm afraid this is not your usual day. We apologize for any inconvenience, but we do not know how long you have been out here. '' <newline> <newline> `` Who is this? '' He asked. He wasn't sure what was going on, but he knew he wasn't allowed to ask. This man who was supposed to speak to him wasn't here. <newline> <newline> `` Mr. President. ''

He made his way into the facility and the whole scene was made quite clear to me. We were all in a lot of trouble in the first place. We 'd pulled off of a large warehouse full of radioactive materials. He had just broken out of the containment cell. I mean, how could he ever be in a cell without a weapon? I saw a security guard break in from the outside, and then a woman in a hospital gown, she wasn't even breathing.

I knew what we 'd do with him. I didn't know what I could do, I just knew we had to go for it. It wasn't easy to explain this to someone who had never seen a nuclear bomb before. <newline> <newline> I didn't know what else to do, or if I could keep him on my heels. But I knew that I had to. We had to kill someone. Someone who 'd actually done something so atrocious. <newline> <newline> A few days later, I got the call from our co-workers. They wanted to know what I did. It was a pretty simple, two thing, I had to do. The first thing they had to do was find an exit plan that worked. It was very easy, I thought. The second thing they needed was an exit plan that had worked. It was then that they asked me if I had any information regarding our operation. I just kept walking to the door. <newline> <newline> And then they showed up. I'm not going to lie. We all went in, and what we found was a warehouse full of radioactive waste. I looked up at the guards, and I saw them standing over us. They were wearing masks. I didn't understand what was going on. But when I looked at them, they were all dead. And they weren't from this facility. And I knew. I didn't want them to be dead. So I told them. <newline> <newline> `` We're going to need an exit plan. '' <newline> <newline> And they said it was a pretty simple exit plan. But it wasn't working. We were just about to die. <newline> <newline> We were all in the warehouse when I saw it. It was the first time in months that I 'd seen something like this. A human being, bleeding, running. I don't know how much of this was real or what I had done. I had to save the human and make sure he died. I felt sick to my stomach. But then I looked up at my partner. He had a slight smile. And there he was. We were going to do it. We weren't going to die here. <newline> <newline> We had to. I don't know how.

How he managed to buy time to do something completely mundane like cleaning the refrigerator for a few minutes, then turn around to see the family sitting on the couch, when a massive piece of paper had come out of his pocket. He opened it and read : <newline> <newline> *Toilet paper in the freezer for two days* <newline> <newline> *Toilet paper for a week* <newline> <newline> *Toilet paper for a year* <newline> <newline> It was quite a large prank, and I didn't want him seeing it.

He went to the kitchen, and he heard the smell of cooking oil and he had a bad fever. The smell of bacon, when he opened the fridge, was really strong, and he smelled it so strong, and he felt like he had died, so he went into the kitchen, and he saw the paper, and he saw the paper was there, and he said to the family : <newline> <newline> `` Look at the paper, '' he said. <newline> <newline> The family looked at each other, and they all knew it was all a joke. They didn't even look up at him, the family didn't even notice, the dad and the mom didn't even notice, and the mom's mother was so upset that she went home to look at the paper and she couldn't even see it, and the dad was so angry, he asked the family if they 'd like to see the paper again, the dad was angry at them, he was angry at the family, but they all just turned to look at the paper, and they looked up at him. <newline> <newline> He was in pain, and his mom, who was in the kitchen, was looking at him with a big, big, big, big eyes. <newline> <newline> The mother started screaming and he looked at her, and then he saw the paper, he saw the paper, and he said to the family : <newline> <newline> `` Please help me! Please help me! '' <newline> <newline> The family didn't even see him, they just walked towards him. They were so scared. <newline> <newline> `` Look at the paper! '' he said. <newline> <newline> The family didn't even see him, they just walked towards him and they saw the paper, and he said to the family : <newline> <newline> `` Please help me! Please help me!

Now, you 'd think that a bunch of Satanists would be proud of me for creating them, but they just never saw it coming. It wasn't until a few years later when a coworker who works for Satan hired me.

Update to 256.3 ? <endprompts> He wasn't home in time for dinner, and that wasn't the first time I've felt a pang of guilt. He's not what I 'd expected him to be. He doesn't have a house to be near, a job to do. My cat's been my pet for as long as I can remember, and he's had me through a lot of stuff. He's my friend, my brother, my love, my best friend. I've lived by his side all of my life, and I love him back. He's the only one who I've known in this dark and lonely part of the world I've wanted to avoid for the last few years. <newline> <newline> When he opened his box, there was a USB cable in it. I plugged it in, and I opened the box to find him with a pair of shiny pink tails attached to the sides. He was wearing a long, grey coat. I couldn't have been more than thirty years old. He had a greenish tinge to his cheeks, which were now pale green. And he had red eyes, which were now a deep, fiery red. It was the worst feeling I've ever had, and I never expected to feel that same when I saw him. I started feeling like I was looking at some kind of mirror. The whole situation felt real, and as he was looking at me, I felt a strange, inexplicable guilt. <newline> <newline> I tried not to think about what he had seen. If this was some kind of sick joke, he wouldn't have been the first one who did this to me, but there was no way he could possibly have gotten rid of me, or at least have cared.

I hadn't seen him in a long time, and I couldn't have been more thankful. <newline> <newline> I began to feel guilty. I wasn't sure if this was normal, or some kind of cruel prank. I looked at my cat. My cat's tail was a bright green and sparkled as it wiggled. He was a bright, fiery red. I put my hand over his head, and he started twitching and flicking, his tail wagging as he tried to get his head on my lap. He was so bright and bright. <newline> <newline> I felt the guilt, the anger, and I almost didn't know what was going on. I was just being silly, and I couldn't know if he was the best person I 'd ever known. The whole situation was so crazy, and I didn't know if I was safe. I just... tried to ignore it, trying to do as little as possible. I couldn't do anything to help him. I wanted him to be happy. I wanted him to have a good life, and I wanted him to do what I had to do. <newline> <newline> As I watched him flutter his tail and make out with the other two kittens, I heard a knock at the door. I stepped into the living room. I saw the other two kittens standing there, and my wife looked at me. Her face was still red. My cat sat on my lap, and she looked at me like I was insane. I began to feel guilty. I was just imagining things. <newline> <newline> I slowly opened the door, and I saw a dark brown box under the lamp. It was filled with a USB cord. It was almost black, and it opened up to a very long string of numbers. I pressed play, and it popped open. My wife was gone.

[ WP ] To keep up with challenges by mortals , Death must master every new game that comes up . But there 's one game that he just ca n't figure out for the death of him . <endprompts> *The game is Death* <newline> <newline> A game about winning the game, which is a long game. <newline> <newline> Death has been bored with life for as long as I have. I am the last of my kind, and I have been trying to defeat him for years. I haven't even won a single game, with all the death that I have experienced. In fact, Death has become pretty popular. At least, that's what I think of it. I have been thinking this game over and over, and the one that keeps me sane is a game about survival. It is a lot of fun, but there are always new challenges to take my place. There's always a new challenge, and every time I get the chance, I have to kill him. <newline> <newline> I am starting to lose faith in death. I know I am a monster, but how can I not kill him? I have been thinking about him for ages. The rules are simple : `` You must beat Death ''. And so I do. Every time I lose, I will be on my deathbed, ready to die. <newline> <newline> I do this every single day. I haven't slept in months, and every time I wake up I wake up in death's embrace. I wake up to a new challenge every single day. It's been my only challenge for about a month now, and it's never been easy. For every day where I lose, the challenge gets harder. I just keep beating death. <newline> <newline> And every time I die, I am no different. <newline> <newline> I've been doing this for months now. I have tried every challenge that Death has ever challenged me. I have won several battles, but I have never beaten Death. I have fought death for over a year now, but every time I defeat Death, I am nowhere to be found. <newline> <newline> Death has been pretty annoying for me, but he is also very fun to play with. I haven't been much of a player, so I just play the game in a new style every time I beat Death. I have been using the Death-AI to win every single battle. I am a pretty skilled player, but he has also been annoying me. It's been starting to get to the point where I am almost out of games. <newline> <newline> So there is only one game I am playing every single time I beat Death.

'' <newline> <newline> His voice echoed across the crowded room, like the wind on a cloudless night. His long hair dangled from his shoulders, and his face was hidden by the silken scarf of his white dress. He sat in a circle in the center of the room. The silence filled the room like a bell. The only sound was the echo of a thousand voices echoing in the distance. <newline> <newline> He stared into the darkness of the room, and he could see, even through the haze, an entire room. The air was still, it was cold, and the only light from the fireplace was a solitary candle, flickering softly. The floor was dark, and the only noise was the footsteps, and the faint scent of the night. The man took a few steps back and saw a girl, a young boy in the center of the room, still staring intently into the darkness. He could hear him speaking, but the girl kept whispering. She had always been silent, not like the others. His heartbeat quickened as his heart pounded. <newline> <newline> `` What are you doing here, friend? '' the girl said softly. Her voice was soft, but it sounded so peaceful. He heard her whisper to him, as if she was trying to comfort him. His heart pounded harder and faster. `` I... I can hear you. '' <newline> <newline> `` Please... don't do anything to hurt me, '' she whispered. Her words were sweet, but they echoed in the darkness. It was as if she was saying something in a dream. `` Please... don't... hurt me. '' <newline> <newline> `` I'm just your friend... I... I can hear you. '' He wanted to reach out to her, but his hands were too wrapped up in the shadows.

'' She was afraid, he remembered. She wasn't the first to leave him. <newline> <newline> `` If I kill you, '' he whispered, he thought. He wanted to feel the darkness again. He could feel her cold grip on his sword, but he wouldn't be able to do anything about it. He would be useless. <newline> <newline> `` I... I'm sorry... I'm sorry. Please.... '' The boy was sobbing softly, but his heart beat faster. He didn't want to die like the others. He wanted to see her again. He wanted to know who she was. <newline> <newline> He opened his eyes and looked down at the floor. His heart thumped, and it was painful, but it was calming. He thought about the girl, and the boy, and the silence. He felt himself fading and becoming less and less real. But it was worth it. It had been worth it for him, and for her. <newline> <newline> And so he ran out, into the dark.
