[ WP ] Space mining is on the rise . The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo . Write a news story covering the event . <endprompts> **RexNews 2,631, April 13, 2016. ** <newline> -- <newline> <newline> A rare and, so far, undetermined chemical reaction took place on the surface of the ship during the course of its trans-lunar voyage to the outer- solar system on Friday, April 9. This, though, is not the first such incident to take place in the past three months, though it should have been by now. Scientists of NASA, the United Nations, the European Space Agency, and the European Union all have reported incidents involving large quantities of the same compound in the past. This compound is of uncertain provenance and should not be used, however. <newline> <newline> The chemical, dubbed `` Rosalisk-Toltec '', is extremely volatile and does not have a known safety margin. There are currently no plans to use it in space. <newline> <newline> For the first time, however, the chemical was detected during a routine operation by the American Air Force, which launched the vessel in the year 2054. Scientists, however, have made the discovery that this is a chemical reaction to fuel rockets. It, therefore, has little of the intended, or desired, capacity to travel beyond the atmosphere of the moon. The chemical is classified, and is to remain in restricted and guarded space until a permanent solution is found. The American Nuclear Testing Committee has not made public statements regarding whether or not it would consider it a threat. <newline> <newline> A number of space scientists, including Dr. H.R. Stegel, have suggested the need for a temporary, unguided, unassuming, and uninhabited ship capable of launching the chemical, the `` Rosalisk-Toltec '', in orbit of the earth's Moon. The American Atomic Testing Committee is currently in discussions with several major governments. Representatives from both sides of the

Write a news story covering the event . <endprompts> **RexNews 2,631, April 13, 2016. ** <newline> -- <newline> <newline> A rare and, so far, undetermined chemical reaction took place on the surface of the ship during the course of its trans-lunar voyage to the outer- solar system on Friday, April 9. This, though, is not the first such incident to take place in the past three months, though it should have been by now. Scientists of NASA, the United Nations, the European Space Agency, and the European Union all have reported incidents involving large quantities of the same compound in the past. This compound is of uncertain provenance and should not be used, however. <newline> <newline> The chemical, dubbed `` Rosalisk-Toltec '', is extremely volatile and does not have a known safety margin. There are currently no plans to use it in space. <newline> <newline> For the first time, however, the chemical was detected during a routine operation by the American Air Force, which launched the vessel in the year 2054. Scientists, however, have made the discovery that this is a chemical reaction to fuel rockets. It, therefore, has little of the intended, or desired, capacity to travel beyond the atmosphere of the moon. The chemical is classified, and is to remain in restricted and guarded space until a permanent solution is found. The American Nuclear Testing Committee has not made public statements regarding whether or not it would consider it a threat. <newline> <newline> A number of space scientists, including Dr. H.R. Stegel, have suggested the need for a temporary, unguided, unassuming, and uninhabited ship capable of launching the chemical, the `` Rosalisk-Toltec '', in orbit of the earth's Moon.
