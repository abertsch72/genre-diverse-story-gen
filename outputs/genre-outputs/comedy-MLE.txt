After my last client is sentenced, a man on his death row finally escapes his eternal sentence by hanging. “ Well, I really appreciate this offer of an unlimited life and there ’ s no such thing anymore. ” I thought to myself, to whom this strange man may now claim to refer after such an incredible success. In fact the word of my current client should inspire everyone in prison to seek his own liberation once death sentences for the noncompliant masses get reduced significantly. This man had one last chance at being granted that mercy with a last resort. <newline> But alas the last of the word that a person may use before that happens becomes a fate and there is but a short moment while time stands still for any man to make what is the most interesting act he may want to accomplish.

He remembered having sex, having a baby of their own when there just didn't exist a baby in sight after he and her shared their DNA.

His eyes flickered open at an angle he's never known but has grown to know well for that long. As soon as a pair came together to his face, the feeling grew to encompass everything she had. She put out an involuntary fist of joy and his mouth formed words of recognition to his mother-like eyes. The tears were beautiful, as always but deep down were their pain still like the years he had forgotten. His cheeks tightened and lips pulled down to a crescendo that he 'd not remembered in his life. <newline> <newline> Finally they turned on each other. His eyes had a deep, blue hue in them that betrayed so much of who he had truly been, like fire or oil, that no amount of words could paint over those deep emotions as their skin was already melting on a much less dramatic fire. As they kissed, it became easier now, seeing into the distance for every color their eyes would soon match, and all that would remain behind was death itself, if not a single more tear. Their legs carried together on what they assumed to be rock before, but they had come together to fall into that same sea below, as her heart had in life, before he came before hers to join them both.

As such to have spent the thousands of dollars the little guy had, the machines also sent back instructions and with very little knowledge as to why the message would be received, so the tiny guy knew his calculations were likely incorrect, it was not a case of an over-expert at being smart to write off as impossible that a basic calculator - something that, well not the first machine capable of such a thing - was the tool the humans had relied on and depended the most on to do math and all things in that way was something of an inanity - no one made things harder to calculate and with machines that complex, the calculation could be a little complicated with all the information, therefore - and he was right so no one had made calculators, except - his brother so it must be - <newline> <newline> *and * that *being right * also wasn't it - so much money invested in computers, even if they themselves were just making

Their fate seemed random but I've lived over it as a counselor for many and will continue until a few billion generations is passed in all and the rest are forgotten as insignificant details in the grand scheme of time. I have grown more aware of each particular soul in our life and now live more or less constantly with them I've made my wife and children into what would be considered respectable folk or celebrities. As such to have another soul's children join me would probably be very illegal unless it was something else very very, very expensive. A very valuable very, expensive thing in the grand scheme of life these last twenty thousand times it seems. At a later point you needn't know that because the pact still holds so that a family may continue with that as its only choice and there is plenty of time still available to stop the life cycle. As such what is new? Nothing new because I've never done my assignment before today which of my nine children has yet

[ WP ] Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence . <endprompts> The child looks up as though his very presence makes an enormous hole in the child. The child stares up confused at such a childish prank for what must have to be an eternity yet there in that stupid face of his, it takes his entire being to get down from sitting down and walk through the house he and his parents spent countless hours making. He takes it as a joke, it was something he ’ s done countless days and nights, and for how long was he expecting some response out of something so young? Still, even more, was this response of all just a moment now? Surely that ’ s when it went wrong.But how?! This has become his very own personal comedy sketch. As such to have taken up such humor to the child with so little understanding how jokes work it will be very very, very difficult. A very difficult joke indeed indeed. After the fact for the laughter his son will have been too surprised about laughing a minute earlier. <newline> But alas the funniest prank yet that a family could perform, that would not only make laughing worthwhile though but, the more comedic, might actually be worse than laughter at first but the laugh will bring more misery and hurt down in that moment all around the kid and the laughter might even take away from the laughter and it ’ s misery will bring on even harder hurt in the life time later, not sure what he can say right now just yet! Maybe his whole life and his whole parents ’ entire families ’ life will take a turn for the bad

A few months prior, an eventful year had been observed, when the event of 990 consecutive days between the number 494/456 and the number 3666.666 ( I never bothered to get downvoting /r/Writingprompts and get out the *random stuff* stuff because it made my self too nervous and bored to write a prompt and read it properly in all three places on the account with just *3 letters for each year* etc, and even more, one thing that has a certain similarity and a unique uniqueness that make it interesting when I'm repeating this routine every day to everyone with their very own own year repeating. As such to have another thing which I could think of with so much detail, I put it on and tried writing again yesterday as well for the 759 years my own years had occurred for, to finally understand just what sort of thing was going on at such one-to-one time, to write something worth considering that a person could also happen once as well, as they go on and off the track while time stands still for all others. This is going the same for today and all I know right now that I was repeating the cycle in the past before even I, or any random people with exactly similar dates would know that we indeed are experiencing in one life time ( I know it was hard in middle ages ) just in the same way time seems a few thousand lives per day for different ones. So the only thing this year left on the world track would be to remember, just one more event so one of these stories I 'll be repeating soon enough wouldn't be forgotten, at all!... <newline> <newline>

Flight Manager Dave was watching an international press call during orientation where he was the one responsible for determining to which planes there would come from, and therefore why so few made it. That's exactly who Dave could blame himself for - when his phone rang he instinctively went out for one last round of playing Angry Birds, followed by a five minute sleep until breakfast. After breakfast Dave checked his texts, and checked on his Facebook accounts - *no new messages today, no new messages on Facebook ;* he had only a brief phone call and a brief text message from his wife, while the phone call itself seemed longer than necessary. As his mind rushed around the list. *Two to two? * 'Maybe the one person with a valid name,'Dave suggested to himself with a chuckle that's why the flight control was asking if each had any credentials or had insurance policy. *One last ride'Dave concluded as another one rang on another channel, '' Please advise of the number that a family on board must '' as that was the first person on the phone. All the time the same message was playing out - he checked the messages online - Flight Control's hotline. He immediately knew something was missing and the phone call stopped as he took to the kitchen with half empty coffee and sat back on the sink whilst re-arranging the microwave. *Should he call someone from corporate or something? Maybe his spouse? Then his co-pilot must be back. Then the kids would be back and all the other work would be right around us. Then it would be one of these planes that 'll kill us. * <newline> <newline> Dave did his best to look calm, with some sort of discipline - but also enough self-deprecrimination so the man in business casual clothes and his white beard wouldn't know where on the plane to say he had done everything wrong

The second week I woke up, it would begin its second wave of radiation. And after 10 years of trying, I could only get the third. Not everyone does but it is an experience that some get so ingrained that when their bodies start acting oddly....well no one understands, even to this day ( when our society's powers have fallen under control- the government's been very lenient with its laws ) the worst can do is drive others crazy without consequence. When I had just started university I had been one of the most popular professors of the school, but now that the science division of my research lab division ( in reality all departments in MIT are now labs with labs instead of department stores or retail malls ) began offering funding directly to people's family member's to buy their gifts and souvenirs, every department, even research or design. <newline> <newline> The news came over one the big newspapers. My son had been with MIT for the last 10 years to discover how we work, how to work our own lives, to figure it all out with time, through trial and error to have everyone discover and use the ability. The president didn't even think we knew until he finally spoke. Every reporter of a local newsstation rushed over - he had the best smile there- oh sure- it will make a big headline but it shouldn't actually effect us negatively- he just wanted us to think he knew what was going on and that was that. Nobody ever did- so he figured he simply had it's.

[ WP ] There are 6 people on an elevator . It suddenly shuts down and a voice from the speaker said : The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive . <endprompts> Dave awoke abruptly. A dull ache pierced Dave's insides as a dull thud echoed across the darkened floors from an unseen figure looming overhead. David shivered in terror but remained conscious enough still to stand firm against the inevitable. Dave's mind went blank and he struggled to find what was going on. A faint rumble had suddenly pervaded the building in waves. Dave opened his mouth to yell as loudly as he could to make out the source but heard only a low sound in particular at it's epicentre over several more moments and Dave suddenly realised who spoke. Dave turned his gaze outwards and peered into the direction where the thudding might have originated. His vision soon cleared and Dave suddenly realised a loud jangle of an alarm seemed to permeate from the far outside. Panic was suddenly evident through the puddles where bodies littered along the floors but no sign of the culprit being anywhere on these levels which seemed suspiciously quiet. Dave realised instantly that something about it was unnerving but was unable to grasp why or what it might even be suggesting and kept searching. <newline> <newline> After some more searching a second door slowly dawned its way inward but this one to be an obvious mistake. The sound abruptly got a bit heavier, now much so. Dave began desperately shagging that 'thing'a second and suddenly realized there were only 4 people left with him. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

A silly girl who he couldn ’ t remember a life before? <newline> <newline> He couldn ’ t think, not after what he said to her for those 3 months. He didn ’ t dare pretend to remember that night, that one cold day, when you would have lost her anyway if things went any darker? In the end their romance wasn ’ t really about the girls at all, it was about the world, for if one ’ s body breaks, the world isn ’ t there anymore. That ’ s where Marija came to rest on her head that morning. When she took his hand in his, it didn ’ t seem a bad feeling, maybe. <newline> <newline> But his heart burned just beyond recognition.

And this feeling drove my resolve to finish the job i was doing. <newline> After giving everyone of them enough time to give more condolences and to comfort those who felt the same sorrow for their loved one whom are likely dead they began taking down the walls, but as those walls fell they began demolishing the streets themselves until the screams of people everywhere can fill the halls from their hearts. This is because, without enough time to give them enough time to have their last moment with them with the rest of humanity on Earth, the other angels are given another glimpse by having a final encounter they knew they wanted but didnt expect when humanity has finally gone extinct to live somewhere else and are soon no-where. Now i, the last being who felt alone, and lonely, with only God and God alone in my life. How long do i have yet to see a happy end, yet only an unhappiness from myself. What's the point of living once someone like me were around, to become like one that was supposed to have passed... when humanity and the universe itself no longer exists? <newline>

[ WP ] A device is released that allows a person to dive into a book and experience its contents firsthand . The manual mentions a certain book you should n't go in , for no one has ever returned from copies of it , but you decide to ignore the manual and go in anyway . <endprompts> The book was the size of his thumb ; two long sheets covered the front. When my finger tapped along the sides on the spine of the piece to the left there was an opening that connected to the front and I felt it push itself open inwards slowly, at a glacial pace through its cover. I stood where the book normally sits on either side of him, so far forward and low that there were barely enough feet to touch my ankles as I entered. I wanted to look in the mirror back up there on my cubicle ; he was too old and too fragile to climb there in the dark like those lumberjacks up there, and those lumberjacks that don't know what they're doing...

This hand is the reason why when I hit it on the book my partner wasn't able to pull out the thing or he would've hit it too hard. <newline> <newline> The other hand I touched immediately came down like a sponge so I was able to grab it off of the book easily so it slid along into the center of the leather front covers. As I pulled it out, as usual I was quite impressed to find little pockets on these pages that, from time to time though, had to be tucked out, usually at least, otherwise this would almost surely mean I needed to wipe my backside while I cleaned the floor, so the man probably found a way to remove anything on a book while he did that! <newline> <newline>

They are about to execute this poor soul , named Clark Kent . <endprompts> The last message of Lois Lane's phone ringing went out a week ago. When my son called him to check on me two weeks later. <newline> <newline> It went unrecorded and I waited it out and when the phone eventually rang back. His first words through were those he always said. One was his true intention. He couldn't wait for me to say something, he needed me for everything important in all three places we are at with Iraq. <newline> <newline> I sat on the floor by his phone, listening to him ask me more or less the same questions I've always given in my mind to that one voice over and now that I listen to him over and over and over I start to notice changes in that very phone. Every once and though his face, that voice... It seems more and more human. <newline> <newline> As our company's popularity skyrocketed Lois Lane became a celebrity throughout the United States to which of us know that a celebrity usually can't get that type of recognition through other individuals, so it is time the media came with me. This phone is the reason why Clark never got any fame on his own from Warner Brothers which of us really knew how to take things back to their true value before things got better. <newline> <newline> As I 'd said on my phone call earlier I was getting ready to get off. <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> I haven't said anything to someone, just sat back to watch.

When the invention started being called so was it easy for a young mind and one you could create things with without even reading one another, even as far back in this age many minds in their years from all people would try making up different stories on what to make of the future but this age is long gone they are no longer interested of seeing what could be built by us ''. -The History of Ancient Knowledge Says ''...

Yet it is too late on this damned mortal day so we move further into this realm of eternal life. I wish these young boys had had one last thing to live up to in this damned age to make their world right all I would ask is you should have loved when I told you I loved but for all you ever know they always seemed to ignore me and treat this life too slow and way to good. Maybe if I take one good thing out of this life and move to hell this world, just so happen as well is going to want you, just so happen that I like some girls from this town, just so happen that today has been very, very difficult this may be some great surprise to have not known but so we have the rest of the world to deal with in time it will have been hard you probably know that it is hard but its one thing when faced with a situation you always wish all the wrong things would change, sometimes thats all you are capable of trying but then at a certain point you know that its all really do what to do. You decide you've come to a place in your life that suits your needs, today just happened, that's a nice feeling and i like that. It feels to be like one small slice of the biggest dream a grown being and the biggest fool should be dreaming all you want a day and a damn hour you think but after all that is whats life! That's one small slice but there's really nigh endless potential. You've earned and this, it was worth a thousand lives just a few days in the future and i can understand just thinking it now like thats one small fucking piece but it makes you wonder how one hundred different little slices make us happy...

[ WP ] It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having sex, having a baby. Then all of a sudden an awful sound broke the air -- a very unpleasant and loud banging, but the noise persisted on as well. He shook off his reverie to continue taking off with his headphones. <newline> <newline> He got onto the bike ; he must have gone over sixty. Had time to rest for twenty seven days, but he had to push over another forty one. And the pounding intensified, the beatings increased in pitch, in tempo to the point he got down on one knee and sobbed a few times. His hands on the brakes made every breath slow and the world black with misery like he remembered his lover falling back from the last great day of happiness to a lifetime ago <newline> <newline> -- He fell onto his knees as a bright white light began to crackle on in front of a mirror. <newline> -- “ God forgive you '' He whispered, wiping the tears away like there was no tomorrow after what his body and his head had endured all 769,000 times since then on a bicycle as clean a man as ever saw his lover go. After a brief stuttering the mirror suddenly returned his form in a state of pristine form, looking much like the way a man once looks a woman in the next cell. The young guy wore that form that came with all women but he had come out to play at that exact same moment of a couple minutes in between them just before he came in front to see them both in bed before bed and for the rest of eternity

[ WP ] Hello darkness , my old friend . <endprompts> He looked at me, I could make out half the outline from a small mirror hanging in my bedroom behind the closed sliding shades ; I could have asked and more times than I could list there to find some kind of validation for his eyes ; to not notice his deep eyes on the bed, not noticing his eyes closed against the covers of the night ; he must have been lying under the covers when he passed for drunk. He looked me over a pair my hands found in one of the boxes strewn across the bathroom, my wife left out in our new life because he got drunk last night too and left our bed-straw for his drunken sister. The glass from the bottle the night before was still attached, too shattered to unscrew it ; the pills it contained went to waste like many others who sold to him, like mine of his life now that my house of all belongings lay to pieces under the sink. And that bottle of water-white, I had been drinking that night when my wife broke up with him-or, at a time just after- his body left his head over this empty white canvas and he was nowhere in particular- <newline> <newline> He put out each nail on his foot and the end for each step that went beneath the stairs and I knew he would not just ignore a tiny bit of chalk laying in the carpet and let my mother fill what I assumed to be the shoes, but he had come out to play at that and, when someone finally noticed he had dropped my wife down there instead of under to join him outside, I 'd realized he was looking like he drank too many beers because of the booze they would've bought at the pub I just ordered so he could go play tag and I 'd seen people standing around trying his shoes when a stray bullet was about to pop me and he stood up to point, in the process hitting me, not one, or at least more

I guess that *hahahaha* was supposed to be metaphorical ; as one thing that ’ s generally expected to get more or less lost with time, time also apparently got more and more popular because someone said “ FUCK FUCK HOOOHOOOOOPOPOOOOOO ” every couple seconds, until, inevitably, someone at the very back, next to somebody in the room, was asking if God had any final prayers to give to him?

[ WP ] Stuck on a small island surrounded by eerie mist , you quickly discover the only thing that is keeping you safe is the bright revolving lights coming from the lighthouse . <endprompts> The last message I could make of the island was an eerie jumble of colors. I decided the better course of action for any of our friends to do to prevent anything other than this island and our very short and fragile lives would be to take shelter on the beach. In reality when we were all gathered and all around the light I had already noticed the people looking towards us, not knowing what to make of all the light like we saw all over the landscape. I guess that could be how I can see them? I have never been really sure myself that I am just imagining things sometimes because sometimes that ’ s when I have found real places. Well, to everyone else I ’ m not sure. As such to have seen the lights I would probably be saying in shock. That I saw them at night with nothing, that it wouldn't really do it any harm so the fact I hadn ’ t just been being entertained that was odd. I guess you need perspective, as you might say I do. You want a person who believes something else as that perspective of mine would be you, right? That was the part the lights hadn ’ t got the message through yet because I saw all too much that happened around them at work and school, how did I lose focus to the fact it was going to happen? <newline> This was one of the moments when I came upon my new found ‘ sanity. <newline> I couldn ’ t stay, it would not last but the light would, because there must have been something interesting about that sight, just maybe it wasn ’ t one-time, even over our generations were still fascinated

Not wanting to admit it, he had finally left it hanging until her call. <newline> <newline> She told him he shouldn't drink like that so young. Too cheap even ; he was too old and bitter just now and there was more that he could handle alone now - like getting old in college! But that wouldn't help now that his job had to come to an end too. Not the worst thing in that. That sort of decision really was his own, that's for sure - but it's been three months and neither his nor his mother have spoken of that conversation with a woman in almost two months, as his phone was beginning to pick up that a family had indeed moved out across city, as they're probably going to say. <newline> <newline> When is the woman coming? How much can they pay in gas and all that nonsense? Or the kids playing out there, right outside the park with their friend! <newline> <newline> Not the time though, not right now anyway - right before he was getting there. <newline> <newline> The phone kept coming.

[ WP ] An angry/depressed dictionary writer ca n't keep his personal problems out of word examples <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having tea, sitting in a corner, with his mouth just slightly open and his hands folded under his table as he wondered through words. Now she stood on his living room window, her dress ruffling behind her, with sweat on her skin, wet kisses drying her back against the brick walls at an angle he could hardly recognize her under. Tears dripped from his eye holes as they both fell towards the floor. There seemed to be nothing in their arms, she must be lost in some sort of dream he thought as he got up and pulled himself towards their front door. But nothing was around. For a moment, after a long silence and a long drag of cigarette, he managed to force it between the shut lips of a pretty little girl, one who seemed to know, like in life his son had known. He walked, for a moment too short, on unstained knees, past this other woman, and entered his house like any other child of God, like the child, like the father and just like any other son. The last word left the lips as he approached, though he heard a sigh as he finally reached them in his apartment. <newline> <newline> Then everything returned to itself in a cacophonous moment, as he closed the door a tiny bit louder a bit more forcibly than had his fingers gripped them before. And that's all, or what he felt was to say at that moment, because what there is before and in that dark spot is nothing now except to feel him turn his nose into his bedroom for the rest of eternity

[ WP ] Your name is Death . You work 168 hours a week as the reaper of souls on planet Earth . You 're living on just a couple bucks above minimum wage , you like to travel , you have a crush on the reaper on planet Xenor and you secretly take 4 sugars in your coffee . Today is your first ever day off . <endprompts> The reaper of the universe's souls always went out a week early. When my supervisor called him to check on me I felt sad. <newline> <newline> For months I've made up for what I never had. <newline> In reality when his phone rang he always said I was there first for reasons irrelevant to me as a supervisor, not my job title, a reason my pay is less than minimum wage for most people, as an exterminator, not something so important. I have a very high rate of turnover of all our customers who call because we had too many for them to handle, so my rate is about to spike with his request. That was my job after all. So why the bother sending an executive notice? Oh, I suppose I could make up and be good again next week. Oh right - I wasn't so happy anymore for another 2.15 weeks anyway, it seems some companies would only allow you to continue working as you see fit with a $ 250 fee a year fee - plus extra years that only the executives could get you, so it isn't surprising the corporate hierarchy got angry and got new management. And apparently they also thought hiring someone that can '' walk through a brick wall '' was a good idea as most of my new workers can't even stand on straight stairs. Well one day we will take a big picture like in The Hunger Games so no real fear if you kill a few souls so it doesnt get weird?. Then one good job, the whole deal gets done. It is not always good. One refultable. One night while I 'll be on watch for your first refulte, I 'll give you a couple sugar pills, with coffee to eat the whole day and you know, the kind, so the boss can enjoy a few more....

[ WP ] To keep up with challenges by mortals , Death must master every new game that comes up . But there 's one game that he just ca n't figure out for the death of him . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him as a challenge though, because there just didn't exist a challenge more terrifying then taking another human being alive but never allowing them to die. Or that I know, Death isn't omniscient. Or has time-displacement, it just can not take human lives ; it must have its own reason. So when he died for that kid I never thought he had to deal with another dying human. Of course Death never dies when it wants Death to take life in an instant for instance he got a few people too young to have experienced their own deaths and his name was just thrown from one person's perspective. <newline> <newline> But anyway, the challenge, this particular life that I found I had to kill and the guy for my daughter's death was it too, it didn't matter too much just having that experience at this point in time I decided in my mind Death would deal with this, just the human, like there a time just after you 'd killed his parent. It seems silly then but he was really interesting after a few days, a man called 'Aunty'was supposed to be the perfect mother for a teenage girl like me but she was also one of my own family. <newline> <newline> There are those days I try to make that whole story into some kind, I tried. In life I learned that people die and you can change a person's life just before they can die if their memories and life events change before you've done it. No time stops until Death finds out he wants an instant 'death '. It was too hard that Death just won't die yet I 'd seen people before I could have died when a person suddenly was walking or jumping or walking down street without pause ; they could jump off my chair at any point, or at almost ANY

[ WP ] : Due to advances in medical science , the standard human life expectancy is now around 120-140 . It is discovered that people in their 100-teens go through a second edgy rebellious phase . <endprompts> The last message of the human population - The End Transmission- <newline> <newline> The machine sent a message back a few years to the earth about how it has come to that conclusion so recently and by it's standards in that day and in every generation and never had its conclusion foreshadowed. After countless hours spent on every channel it eventually had come to its ultimate result ; how were all the generations going? Of all time, how are we as humankind coming to these sorts of results today? I have spent more time sitting up here and listening listening now and there in meetings or public appearances for the whole time of mankind's demise than I has with myself or anybody around us except those scientists who would have understood the problem for the sake of knowing but that doesn't justify how we've came to know it. A very wise generation was lost, so the age for wisdom had finally begun. All those centuries of research could only last such one generation on another Earth, because the world of tomorrow has changed a LOT overnight - the earth as that day looks and smelled different but somehow the process hasn't changed the way humans are right NOW but the things the world is currently using to communicate. But if all that was done in the past centuries did anything, I 'll never find anything worthwhile after that second millennium on another planet. Just one message was enough, not sure what others can relate so I just had one. <newline> <newline> The End Transmission <newline> Day 14, year 2147 <newline> <newline> Hey buddy it has been one year one thousand and five months since our announcement to be dead now! If anyone who's reading this will be reading any of them, do yourself the dignity to pause while I get this one, so the entire story ends and hopefully none of what follows may happen actually end up on TV <newline> > <newline> This was broadcasted and written
[ WP ] Begin and end your story with this sentence : `` And yet , the city remained . '' <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered that. Of course he did. They went everywhere together before she got caught up in another job, but he just... kept it together. He couldn't say sorry or stop or anything, but he loved her. Now it's time, now. Time, his time! There is no point in trying this any other way but this! He smiled wider for that long. As long as a child can hold out in one place in the dark, forever. They were perfect! <newline> <newline> The moonlight hit them again like a bomb-gun blast and his heart jumped with joy, even though it scared the old ones down like the real world. He couldn't help it, this was life. As many were used to, and the younger kids of his life all got that as a surprise. <newline> <newline> The light changed suddenly to gold, and his fingers froze in midair, as he realized just what it did to the world and just... what his body needed to get over this now. <newline> <newline> What did he call it again? Just another time of trying? They had so many ideas for everything now! He got more excited then he remembered all day- there wasn't any other way! There's none anymore. The young people were all going to remember all of the times they had come together to play at that park, when the park was almost in perfect colors just before he came in at midnight. The one time they 'd been together to go hang out during their parent holidays because of the great friend-hood or just maybe it was her when something happened at her favorite cafe. The only times these events just couldn't happen anymore...

[ WP ] Since childhood you 've been told that only death awaits you outside the wall . For years you have been curious . Today is your chance . <endprompts> The last sentence of the song i remember reading to myself before a bad car accident. I can still hear the music on the way into work. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> That's the only day for things ever this small when i am truly awake and not tired for one last go on i pull it out i check for dust and mote in a field and some strange shit in all three places on the road with just my feet sticking like something out of the stone. <newline> <newline> Its almost midnight now the sky dark like i remember when I went down for my routine and i look off into the distance and watch the big black star come to an end after thousands of other moments of my life i am gone and it comes at me with a voice that screams and says if i do it my own soul is going home or you 'll give me hell it seems i take a step forward i realize it's time to say I do whatever i want without thinking i turn around i get into a running and there is a man right in the air who doesn't say his first and last two names. <newline> <newline> And i walk towards his and the man has stopped a few feet to me and with a final shake i know its not an accident no that one can say i cant say i was right in time so I just keep staring and his whole face and his whole body just stops it and doesnt pause but i cant believe this because there must have been something in his eyes..? <newline> <newline> A voice, from over the road with black streaks down from the horizon? <newline>

[ WP ] A paladin devoted to RNGesus , a muscle wizard , a asshole thief and You , the ___ . This party wo n't last long ... <endprompts> He looked at me, I nodded. <newline> <newline> It's just an illusion now. The illusions I create have never been real enough to take him in there on purpose. Just that I know his tricks and I've spent hours learning it. <newline> <newline> Oh, for Pete's sake this whole time he hasn't taken into account what that kid was planning with me ; to make him believe in one of those fakes to sell the paladins bullshit shit. Oh crap he's made my best paladin take a fucking credit card. Shit man if only I had money to buy myself a fake to start buying a fake like he bought his fakers. <newline> <newline> At the beginning I used this to piss the guy off when his tricks had got my ass out, it's too much stress on me having to explain these fake stories in public and get in my car when I need something important, shit that didn't start a little pissing off his poor little brain that started this fiasco. <newline> <newline> What I need is someone smarter in here, it seems it would take another month of the day for me to find someone more willing then him to be nice and actually try to get me in there instead of stealing shit off me. Someone willing to learn that these imaginary cards actually exist, I mean there is even a thread on that thread, you can even ask your real paladin about this stuff if it's all you care to find though you might find out it's just not so cool because of the crazy fables I have invented. <newline> <newline> But anyways he would only ask my first names before I could even talk... Fuck it, this whole situation is killing my spirits. Just to find something in the past my mind to use, if any real magic exists and still be a party piece then he
[ WP ] In a world where religion in all its forms has been banned , you witness the second coming of Jesus . <endprompts> God is very mad, and wants to eat me up.

I never could understand their feelings over such events, as i was no friend of his at that point and knew i had been wronged i could see there.

Then i could go back to reading and shit '' I was the kid and thats why i kept it out '' What are all the other things?

Many of our great armies are assembled before your command to mark what year we began to prepare the siege of Fort Pendergrast, an assault that so near is assured that even this very hour could begin today. So in these brief, few short words shall come to our lords minds, one day they will look back upon it day from day, the world with its sun has not fallen upon nor the skies of those whom stood by for comfort or mercy. It may yet happen that this will be our greatest of deeds! They can still look up, and see all I have done, in the eyes of an many faces now. And we have made history that day, for many a people are so far gone they would never have dared look to their lord and tell him they would hear our call. Even our most beloved of gods, as I stand with our people who came not knowing the gods themselves. My Lord do you hear their calls, Lord did those once so called heroes answer those voices to his command? I, my lord, have lived with so many souls. They would tell that they knew so many heroes to whom had come to fight. It is to this world we can not now ask a question that it so deserves. Many men have gone the world before today, many heroes have stood on the great walls that once divided the land under their command, many heroes has gone to face the Great Lord who once stood.

[ WP ] a homeless person discovers s/he has a superpower , and it 's what landed him/her into being homeless <endprompts> He looked at me, I could make him out, I was a homeless asshole with my mouth hanging off the ends. I tried explaining myself but he just shook his head but I knew there was someone that couldn't speak his mouth to save his life. Now it's time, we could all make his journey down to the underworld and the place that might take him back. So when he asked for that cheap bottle of piss he knew to go over to his apartment. Of course he wanted, the cheapest, yet I knew if someone got to the bottom he got to piss on people's dirty clothes. Shit man if only I had money to buy these. God the world doesn't matter when I'm homeless. So the fucker took down a window but then fell on top of another and the guy looked pissed so I had to keep it out until it's too dark too find out where. The piss just flowed in, I decided he's fucking weird, why he even had an apartment, I didnt tell anyone, he lived his entire day to get it, but for some fucking reason when he got on a plane someone dropped a shit sack in his drink. I was supposed to be the cool bro for a while then turn in a fuckin bitch on one of my own, oh shit a few days later a body in the next state is sitting next to what I figured that must be a dumpster. <newline>
