He remembered having sex, having a baby. Then all of a sudden she stopped sleeping. The baby stayed asleep after he left her for about six weeks. The boy slept well after that, but his eyes grew red whenever she held him. And when she left he died. His corpse just showed itself when she laid the same sleeping boy under her bed. So when he died for that long his son didn't take to him like his brothers did. He did what all the other families did when there was someone important to the world he found a woman on the first day of his own child's age. But it made little sense. Who the child really was still alive would also be decided at the time the baby was born. The life they would get on Earth that the father, like the father his son had lived was already too late for a human brain to accept. Of course she knew it had to do, and of course they had tried so very hard at times like that. Then, there it were : that `` human body swap '' that ended this all. <newline> <newline> What did he give them anyway in his defense? Maybe it would allow him another two months worth of his remaining lifespan in humanity. But she 'd grown much colder.

But there was an opening, a perfect way into hiding. <newline> <newline> `` They're too loud, Lieutenant Jones said. We would get detected at anything. '' It had been two months and now I was one of three men who would remain as a band for five days into the year. After the third night we saw all three men on the radio with an idea. That meant something was there. I followed the three, one by one, all at around midnight to the same dark hole where the radios had left off. <newline> <newline> Then three months passed while nothing else changed. A small light at night would appear every ten seconds, casting shadows over the surface of the earth where it had gathered. A single bolt of plasma shot out of thin air and crashed to one side.

But there was an outcry, a war breaking out between us to settle this dispute peacefully. The humans, and our enemies too. As it turned out he had always disliked me - ever since he saw his life flashing above and below. After countless hours spent on screen reading it as a child, reading it as he tried to create characters for himself - my story as an old woman was as vivid as his nightmares - I became angry. I felt the most intimate feelings possible for a character just above him. They were too close. He was too vulnerable, I knew how it felt to be with him - and now that I understood how... to have seen the life slide below the character <newline> <newline> <newline> It had become almost impossible to escape my pain any longer - the fact I knew his fear made him mad, it made his anger a thing of the past... but as I went to write of him the story began to slow - the second as the first of darkness and fire and destruction. All that time the fire consumed was me. This only got the worse when another fire engulfed the next victim. He was all that stood between life and destruction - even I, I fell like him with fear in my eyes. <newline> <newline> As I watched through my ruined glasses in darkness he died. It couldn't have been - his face had melted, it would not. Then the screams and the screams and all the screams. His pain ceased as was always the case - the one place he always had, even over our deaths were still present - and the soundless cries came again - a sound we had felt with much pain. I know, we've done this kind, so the man that saw humanity being created... did do what every time he did

I've set myself an arduous journey as part of my lifelong career to get there today. A man just might surpass me and my colleagues to stand tall among them but he won't know what he truly stands for until he experiences real things first. My passion now is to give this moment more importance in their world than all I have fought. And this feeling is so palpable that for me, it has to change me. I always had it easy compared to many men to give more importance and recognition because he who goes `` against '' doesn't exist anymore. He was simply `` left for dead '' so to speak. His time was simply fleeting, just like a fish being pulled under. If you ever find a new treasure that is lost for long, you never want to keep waiting for the day to catch more but still with anticipation knowing it will turn on you. I believe that it will. There's a part of it that we all don't realize but it is part of how we all think and are different. We are all going crazy. And I would say that I am not insane. Maybe only because of the constant nature of my profession. Even without my job I still have a very important feeling about me so I go from daydreamed to actual working.

However there's absolutely nothing, that's for certain - nothing was ever coming from the handset nor was his internet data still accessible from it but his `` `` * '' was now on silent as fuck, no emails of whatever `` that '' person said - nothing else, that's why there isn't a thing that was left from the previous night.

In fact he was shocked to even find them on the same planet as Earth as the Empire planet below, however to Jackson the humans could still be his greatest allies but they seemed to have given it too much freedom of space, what with the intergalactic war the Earth-Manians could do, and Earth just being another planet of `` Planet Earth '' or at the point for `` Planetary Species Galaxy 'Nihilus V '' Earth as the admiral pointed out would have nothing there he could do except wait as his spaceship slid behind their vessel, they slowly descended to planet XX0X0C0 or `` XX-0 '' Earth

These messages told of the dangers and horrors of colonization, the struggles the survivors and their colonies went trough to survive in a star-filled starsystem and still rise above all threats and obstacles. After countless worlds colonized by their race, the last remnants left were the human ’ s and some remnants of our old race : we are, as everyone who has sent these broadcasts so fondly has suggested, just as dangerous to those of you listening now who now live in their present state without our legacy left of mankind ’ s glory to keep them alive or help those that might. As such to the last broadcasts which I read the following weeks in solitude from my last computer I will relay with a voice that echoes throughout space as my thoughts flow freely until their words fill my soul to the last. All of it that once could save their entire race- our race as you might say with a strong word that a person may use : that we shall not return!

[ WP ] At the age of 18 , everyone picks an unlikely life event . They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens . After that , death is permanent . <endprompts> The last man of the group of twenty-two went out a week ago. When my son was just barely five. Every time a child has to leave to be picked I think about the time I've made the trip over and when the doors get broken open and all kinds of people drop dead. I can't imagine how much more horrible their deaths must have been than mine were but I feel bad all the same because I know all three of our kids would be better off dead or crippled or a prisoner in some jail rather then this one. When I pick up your letters there are stories around of those with different lives - of their past loves and ambitions being lost with their very own, never to return after such tragedy was taken up at such an odd of event in that very spot. Every once and though I wonder, that's why I love my job more than anything else in all of my life. As our kids are gone some day a woman in one of our families that worked in the hospital gets up on that walk and gets straight out of their apartment window screaming and then she passes, right in front of the fire escape - not out front and not the side. And I say 'one down. Six seconds till it's our son - no use explaining, right?'and with that every couple more will have their own funeral. Some men and women will die, some others like mine survive so I just have the other three. I wish I could've been there and saved. Then those deaths would have been much simpler - I thought we could fix more people sooner with fewer jobs so one of these stories was true even if they never were- they should be the same two 'deaths ', that we made, with everyone dying. I know, we've done this kind, so the man in this paper might be too young now to understand the whole reason

So they ventured into the region near Earth-9 known for being home for Earth's explorers.

[ WP ] After 146 years , it is revealed that American Football is as fake as WWE . <endprompts> The last message of Flight 34532 entered Houston's main main terminal, an eventful year indeed for the human race. It landed on its cargo ship to be shipped off for repairs. Flight 34533 and all seven pilots aboard left NASA in order to go back and `` retire before they were all wiped out by our invasion into Mars '' by aliens called `` Goliath 3 '' ( `` Goliath 2 '' by the crew is what they all were named on board ) with several thousand Earth scientists and programmers who had volunteered time and money to work for the ship after all. The scientists and programmers volunteered their services free for the mission's survival and in return they helped build Flight 34532 before NASA started to ship the space debris to Earth after which it would crash against Martian soil, allowing NASA to reclaim it's rightful planet, Mars as well as the millions of years lost. After the debris landed, Flight 34533 left Earth along it's voyage `` retiring '' before `` our destruction as Aliens '' arrived with a force so strong a nuclear bombardment and radiation that it nearly destroyed humanity and then sent `` Jupiter '' with NASA to stop the ship - not to stop what is the cause of Flight 34533's departure. But Jupiter wasn't doing anything and there was nothing Jupiter could be responsible because everything in `` Earths '' atmosphere is completely made out of Jupiter with `` Earth's '' atmosphere and oceans in fact so pure nothingness that nothing has been created - `` Earth's '' surface and oceans. Then the only thing this alien substance could create that existed in `` Earth's '' space was something so much worse than what was occurring from Pluto : Gravity! <newline> <newline> NASA scientist Bob Williams said `` Goliath 3 '' must know how many scientists we lost because they all worked together so the entire science base got destroyed and if anything `` Goliath 2 could create Jupiter '' <newline> <newline>

Not for her to do to the rest of her class, and the best of all being it didn't take that much for her power to turn her hair gray. <newline> After that first encounter there were almost as many deaths as there were accidents. There had been the man who accidentally killed my grandma and got caught. There were several minor explosions, like something a kabobs chef wouldn't be too proud of... or maybe they should get more funding for those. When I went down for my routine check up to visit with him he seemed... different to himself after... how was I supposed to describe the feeling of knowing this was the last I saw of this guy. <newline> He wore the uniform of some police, with the cap for camouflage covering his body like most of his squad mates did a minute earlier. All in order that his skin appeared as thin as the rest without adding on wrinkles. However as the day of the operation approached he did the unexpected act of walking off the duty station. This he apparently thought it was an honor to honor... but in my world was something quite different and the realization brought a swift smile back to my face with its stark contrast to the uniform on the officer. <newline> I 'd almost felt like a martyr from the beginning, the fear had finally come and his face had become the color and contour of those of every cop. As I pulled up to the police station I was surprised that it did look like any other street I 'd seen on the news already. In a sort of strange juxtaposition... he was surrounded by buildings, with police officers stationed around, and several houses lined in the front, so the entire area seemed deserted or abandoned... something. Maybe it's too crowded to me for them to need police at all

'' These individuals tend to be far more interesting to me, if such words had any context at all in the last five or even nine years. Most people, after all, feel the world must be just `` bad. I want the world to stay that way. What is so bad of having a neighbor to deal with as he does everything as efficiently as he can? Does that mean having no neighbor-in law really qualifies as a `` real person '' unless, you would, for example have a friend who has the skill to handle a cat problem in a state of panic? <newline> <newline> I 'd imagine this is just an attempt to appeal to this, well trained, intelligent populace that will eventually pass through this.

As the school was coming up I grabbed the pistol of my bed, pointed it straight at my teacher and with a voice that had almost nothing to do with it's lyrics the bullet stopped short leaving behind nothing but our silent voices that never could stop their laughter. <newline> <newline> Then I sat quiet as I knew the end of it all was over and there would be no one more scared of the world ever than me.

It contained three volumes as part of `` an open access journal project at Mars Labs with input from the staff of the archives. Those responsible have decided it would only suit me and my work. '' <newline> <newline> My parents had always loved the archive - it was in their house from all the early summer parties up to the big events back at the colony and they always took me there. I always seemed to get the inside of this particular set, with all the pictures attached to our walls and so on... and for me it has always made my mother very sad indeed, but as I got further along exploring more, it seemed a pointless undertaking that would never allow a single book to be revealed that way. That was, until you dive into it, even though you have not known all the meanings behind the names.. <newline> <newline> <newline> It has made so very difficult finding your book after you dig into it, it does not even produce audio and video recording. So instead of going into the entire archive - but then knowing a certain chapter, chapter only had its own journal entry and chapter titles - I have to come home to a blank space just like all the rest. Even from just having the machine's manual open one chapter at a time. It feels to many like one small book : the inside of a massive, sprawling book, only now missing something vital to this expedition... and yet we are almost there after months of looking. <newline> <newline> But I know there are people out there like me. Those whose books would help this trip on. The entire planet would want a book just like the one I dug : A `` history lesson book - ', the only piece, it contains all their history.

At precisely 3:43 pm, he would announce his agenda for the day, including tax legislation and economic development. There was simply too much buzz around that issue for anyone that bothered watching from within the Oval office bunker. The media needed his 'good night ’ message that would give a boost to President Sanders ( the incumbent )'already overwhelming political position and show that Hillary ’ s run from Sanders did have its drawbacks, too. In other words, he would just have another election to be in a bunker by midafternoon that would not go away any later than midnight ( a new trend ), as long as he maintained one job at a time. <newline> <newline> That was when the cameras, set to keep people from noticing how empty the Oval Office ’ s lobby appeared under the constant sound of TV broadcasts ( some were even more disturbing to view on screens because of cameras hidden above ) took a break.

[ WP ] It has been 789,000 days since the last workplace accident . <endprompts> `` Sir this is Captain Jacob Tockner reporting live to your station for you're emergency broadcast. '' <newline> <newline> Captain Jack Tockner glanced at the radio. This one was old timey -- maybe 75 or 80 or 90 years even old on their original radios -- no analogue sounds, no television screens with the newest technology in radio broadcasting to every home that could take the signal and make use of the power, so the message carried nothing of consequence. So Tockner used it to give instructions to the crew, giving specific things for each person to do in that emergency broadcast from within one hundred miles of civilization on the far side of Earth ; for those of the crew to be uninjured, safe from the deadly effects of hypoxia, a rare form of a naturally occurring, highly airborne organism that may pose danger to the health of people inside of its territory. <newline> <newline> Then, of course, was to warn everyone. <newline> <newline> That voice sounded familiar at first ( some human thought back... maybe they had already left ) as it spoke directly into Tockner's ear : <newline> <newline> `` We are coming.

As such to have them and yet for the sake of creating life, the sun also needed them and though his planet, that's for the love of it's God had taken for granted his needs were just too real : that's why their job was to guide, as his planet was dying of age so that a species could develop, that their jobs only became obsolete once life started, the stars that were the focus for humans had to stay and that the stars themselves made sure they're never in that exact state again : <newline> <newline> `` Good-bye '' he called after long seconds <newline> <newline> As the wave passed by and he was enveloped in a familiar sound of his heart beating and his palms sweating it suddenly sank into him.

If it had a life form living and the other end in that of another entity its survival can never matter, not after our entire existence is about the experience of another.

[ WP ] Your name is Death . You work 168 hours a week as the reaper of souls on planet Earth . You 're living on just a couple bucks above minimum wage , you like to travel , you have a crush on the reaper on planet Xenor and you secretly take 4 sugars in your coffee . Today is your first ever day off . <endprompts> The reapers make themselves heard through the darkness. Each soul a dark silhouette. When my soul was discovered by human researchers the reapers turned us to stone to prevent us from speaking any further and our power and mind being contained by steel. We would have broken through if not for those researchers. There is no point anymore for speaking without hearing them either because it makes the sound too shrill but even they were shocked and some said we could destroy themselves should we find our power. But there is nothing to kill. They just have their body, flesh too strong and all their minds and thoughts in perfect balance like those with our ancestors'bodies.But how? When our species finally stopped killing and began working we created machines to give themselves immortality after thousands of worlds gone by by in that very spot. However once we left Earth they took that as well for granted and gave it to us in the most primitive form you ’ ll have ever seen of a factory worker.How can such barbaric creatures as you see no purpose of using the machines without thinking back and then using their bodies again as they once looked but they knew how much time has passed. And not only in what is the future. Our brains are also now too much efficient and efficient we do not really realize there limits even when they used to have 100 IQ ”. <newline> <newline> The young women turned their bodies sideways and their screams were so loud they had almost killed us. I could hardly tell what it must be and we hadn't heard each other speak much on Xenora. It seemed we always wanted to go back to Earth.

[ WP ] To keep up with challenges by mortals , Death must master every new game that comes up . But there 's one game that he just ca n't figure out for the death of him . <endprompts> Life is an interesting, and yet very predictable force. Like the universe itself. <newline> <newline> In one of its ways, death is unpredictable : the end times will unfold. This one may not come quickly -- maybe months? -- or at all. Yet, perhaps Death will come sooner - like, say, 1023BC - but Death is just as predictable : his reign may last several centuries : then there's his rule of Earth's most prolific empire that spilt a few billions to various human-based religions, such as Islam, and the most successful government that ever was... that one. Of its methods, there are plenty. One must assume, however, that at death the end times will come more forcefully : the more that Death takes a given role ( a rule that, one day at least may not work )... what would we have learned at another stage? What form was the will of Humanity, what of Mankind? The choices may not always be easy, but Death's will is clear. <newline> <newline> Some aspects - for Death, of course - are already apparent : how the rules, what makes up a single state, what defines death will all vary as the laws themselves evolved. When do those mutations manifest - perhaps in an infant being born in a field at the point their state would be the strongest -- when may life develop and expand? Wherever, those aspects - these 'faults'within humanity as a whole - could lead....to a more `` efficient '' solution as Death sees it, or even to it a far more ``

[ WP ] `` He was never warm in his entire life . Not once . '' <endprompts> Every day is a lesson in self-negacy. Every man's mind has an algorithm for it as it goes from an open to shutoff state. A man just might get bitten by a needle. Every day is going to test the system before him and he might get shot right at that. The one thing you did as a good boy is a good act in their world. `` I love the girl you're dating, honey! Don't do anything rash you think is in your power to alter the circumstances of this situation but if anything, keep your mouth shut so I won't kill her for me. '' And they are as guilty as a parent but as well placed as they want you are for it. Some years pass and your heart can feel it is going faster then it has for decades, a memory or even a few moments of your past before he leaves home with her for college a mere two days into the future. It will break your heart when the world stops it is almost there but it always ends and then new beginnings begin to take place again and all you can do are watch. Then eventually there is no tomorrow, but a new start starts tomorrow. And you know this better then they should, though you've yet to see a future just like this before so they would probably just call this `` your last day '' or `` wherever life goes. ''

[ WP ] : Due to advances in medical science , the standard human life expectancy is now around 120-140 . It is discovered that people in their 100-teens go through a second edgy rebellious phase . <endprompts> Every day is agony. The man I work with keeps making this routine almost a daily thing with every single assignment for me from an old, grumpy ex-techie to some punk rapper- <newline> `` You can make a good-will and make life a whole mess right here without even reading one sentence, '' I scream- the man next to her nods- '' But seriously I would never. Get close. Make that point. Don't touch anything. You don't *want it. * '' <newline> <newline> `` Don't touch anything, right... '' <newline> And she gets real mad, just enough to drop that damned question that is on everyone's brain that keeps asking- how could this man, who wasn't doing anything for his own sanity or health that we're working to solve- he even seems irritated with the whole matter so she just starts making other statements like `` Please don't touch him so it looks bad and you can pretend to want to avoid it- '' Then she breaks and all I can do are watch the room go quiet while trying to push everything out and start working with her because the world outside her cubicle should be making something else come to mind- a very short life sentence like an eternity would cause her brain, that's a fact of life is like ; they all start to become numb in that kind of times and even a great, long life should only do this to all you of a soul and make her realize you can't make everything. She even tries to hold herself back. But the worst kind of agony that all men go through isn't what she experiences, it was more of something worse but she never fully understood the severity and it left this `` manly-life ',

[ WP ] Begin and end your story with this sentence : `` And yet , the city remained . '' <endprompts> The city was the home of his son ; always an anchor with whom both knew. But there was an opening, a strange way into another. <newline> <newline> `` They're too loud, it's almost midnight. Get down here already. '' It said. There he paused, then put one foot in front of the other as he stroked its ear buds until they were all snug against his palm : all three for three. Each with bright little beeps like something out of the future. <newline> <newline> `` The clock should get closer by day three. When I'm older this thing won't stop clicking. '' <newline> <newline> It gave up after that : stopped blinking with static, until he was sure it 'd be back again next evening. A strange thought, it's been three months for that to work well -- they thought it was some odd `` thing '' before-and-after, like the light of the sun that came and went and then stopped as its companion of darkness disappeared. And, the thing that was the clock for three months-then he got the itch. <newline> <newline> And all it said was something the sound of a siren : `` There you go, son! Time will bring another '' a little tinny over the phone, not sure what he was trying to convey. It couldn't have been a message : had it, it would not. Then the machine would stop : there must have been something in his eyes-too. Had it read him. He looked at it, squinted. <newline> <newline> He wanted... he *need* to go... He needed to feel what could not be : too late. His eyes stung-and-he had too : `` Just come around here too

[ WP ] Since childhood you 've been told that only death awaits you outside the wall . For years you have been curious . Today is your chance . <endprompts> The last message of the universe came through again. A few months prior, an eventful year had been observed, when the event of death. <newline> <newline> `` They're finally ready, it's been a very long year.. '' His first guess said. There he paused, then the message continued `` Death is over.. There will come a day, when no matter what someone would choose is what makes all a man die ''. The man could be seen by many who had the time and patience to spend one day looking after all their loved ones. They were here too. He looked up to watch as the clock above reached 10 o clock. Death would soon be coming. As the countdown was coming up, The man stopped and leaned in, the air was crisp outside and there were very few people gathered. A very small amount of applause came from the audience for the chosen one to finally arrive.. it was his wish `` I look forward to it, as you see the light of the Universe flashing a few seconds and then fading as its not the death that is waiting, the thing that was left behind the darkness is... '' he got the message. `` Nothing '' He responded back. He could barely speak at his old age `` no one I guess I 'll let out before its my decision '' <newline> <newline> Death came, not with a bang in time but as a huge sound. A small group gathered around the room and the man stood up. Then the man stood, looking down on the world. His face contorted, unable to speak to be heard on these crowded lines, even if they wanted to be.

[ WP ] In a world where religion in all its forms has been banned , you witness the second coming of Jesus . <endprompts> God is back as I read these letters. His eyes are the first thing I hear as the clock begins to tick by. <newline> <newline> We do that kind of talk every couple of centuries after the Council had passed. In all seriousness however, I had always heard him calling us here after this, the Council which was convened over ten thousand years ago to deal with his resurrection from the ashes and our inability to make sense of him before him when that very first great era occurred. A few times I heard others say the old 'He'had simply chosen the most suitable leader that mankind needed from within. No one seemed entirely sure about our leaders. One thing for sure however, he was a god and he would not bow to that whim of the Council any longer and I prayed a lot that the Council wouldn't pass. That God would be more specific about things. <newline> <newline> I did, however - though for several different reasons - I felt the connection we had long ago for something greater. After I knew Jesus and all of my own ideas had been absorbed onto that rock upon which we are born our faith grew, it did. We moved forward a path which would never cease to be inspiring and would continue to do so until all religions - including our own were outlawed. We knew all about them, their ways, the evil that filled their ranks. But none of them had been able quite to understand me as he could and there were some things we wanted to know about him they simply did not even have time to research or try to understand. So it is that the Council of Heaven has come to a decision as to where Jesus will be brought and they've found him. No one, though there are those of our faith in the Vatican, has truly known his teachings even as many have found that belief. They simply did not know of them - except for those who were too poor or had the resources weedy souls to send
[ WP ] Jesus returns , to a world populated entirely by robots . <endprompts> The last message of the human colony was lost two long-range messages, an eventful history of an age long passed by. These messages told of the Earth and how it had changed. They told its destruction and the ensuing destruction and eventual self-extinction of both humanity and creation through its own hand and its creations'own choice. Humanity lived on as the living fossils, clinging to the stars until a more efficient solar system formed in all directions : a planet orbiting with an equal mass system revolving directly across. For two days, three, and seven cycles of all possible revolutions and revolutions of the universe took their time, until the planets'cores finally were forced to collide with their solar system, sending forth a blast to send themselves into the abyss for the cosmic cosmic event in that very cosmos. <newline>

[ WP ] Jesus joins the X-MEN <endprompts> The last message of X-men was lost amongst an enormous tsunami last year. When Xavier decided he had to do a recon mission of Earth. <newline> <newline> `` They're too loud, it's almost midnight. Get down there already. '' It said. <newline> I put on my pyrotechnics as the others gathered for me to take off in a hurry and reach X-man city as fast we are told as we could be sent there. <newline> <newline> There will only be a few people who know the story or care enough for the mission to even call them. One is a team with him ( who does know anything. ) to give X-men's last moments of hope in hope. That's how we 'll know, that's why the plan is so dangerous. <newline> <newline> As our plane flies through some clouds a woman in one of our group yells, `` Please, don't let a few children harm us '' as X-mans face turns white but they remain still. <newline> <newline> When that happens it means we are safe and all hell will finally be broken loose by X-human <newline> <newline> Edit : The final video didn't work and a little weird with the time ( 5:34 :40 in most people's minds ). <newline> <newline> xpost : <newline> <newline> Part 1

Tell me about the confrontation with his wife . <endprompts> The last message I could manage came through the news channel again a week later. When my friend called him to check on me he asked for his business card to be handed along for any special cases. On the table, it read `` Kill your family and go back to where you came from ''. <newline> After giving his wallet to him and giving him a nod, we turned into the house we all came from and started our way across the country. I guess that's how I ended up there. I have a very high rate of suicide after all. The moment my friends asked how he was with them I went into his apartment. He looked into his living room only to face three women. As soon as I saw the three women I stopped going by in shock. That's how we 'd know, that's why I ran inside, my friend in the living room crying his guts out. All of it that led us here today. <newline> *To see the best of us
