Write a news story covering the event . <endprompts> It was only a matter of time before this had happened again. It was inevitable, if you let yourself see it like that. That oil spill had been a disaster. But then again, so were the nuclear accidents and the wars of the 70s. <newline> <newline> So if you didn't like the current state of the world, or the way it was in 2015, you could blame it on the media. You could blame all those problems on your neighbour. You could blame your kids for being more reckless than you are. You could blame the current politicians and politicians for making your children poor and dying. <newline> <newline> That's what the media did. They made you feel good about your family and your country, but also about the people who were wronged by it all. <newline> <newline> It was not my fault that the spill was brought about by some poor, middle-aged white kid. It was his fault that I was left in the middle of a hurricane, with no backup in place. It was his fault that I had no home and no family. <newline> <newline> He had no power. <newline> <newline> No water. <newline> <newline> No money. <newline> <newline> It was his fault. <newline> <newline> But of course, I blame myself for all this. <newline> <newline> This was the fault of my own hubris and my ignorance. <newline> <newline> And it wouldn't be the fault of anyone else.

A massive armored truck had come in and stopped, and a group of 10 men was sitting on the roof of the building where he had been sitting. It was getting dark out, and the rain had come down hard. He looked out at the city, and couldn't help but think of that time in Berlin, where a man had been able to take out a police guard and force them to give him a lift down the street. <newline> <newline> But, he had done his duty, and his job was done. A German man was on the roof, and he was about to shoot the SS men who were going to come to take him. The man who had been on the roof, a young German man named Paul, had taken out two SS men with a shot. After the first one had been shot, another had been shot. <newline> <newline> This had made the second man very scared, and he had started shooting at Paul, but Paul had kept shooting and he didn't die. The second man had started getting up, and was now laying on the ground, dead. <newline> <newline> Then another explosion came, and another group of men started running back down the street. <newline> <newline> But this had turned out to be an all out ambush, and all of these men were now dead. <newline> <newline> But that wasn't the worst part. <newline> <newline> A second explosion came next, and this time it wasn't a sniper but a tank, and he couldn't stop it.

If you aren't going to go through the trouble of being in one of those small pods and go through those procedures, how are you supposed to find something to take to the grocery store, then go home and take a piss?

There's an endless supply of these things. Everyone knows these things. They don't care, you have nothing to lose. The only thing they have to worry about are their own lives. <newline> <newline> Of course, this was what I thought. It's a shame really. I had gotten to the point where people would come to me, begging me to buy their drugs or give them money. I had to try to give them drugs, but there were so many ways they could use drugs. I just had to make sure I had the right ones, and that I never used something so vile. They would do anything for money, it was a part of their world. <newline> <newline> Of course, I wasn't supposed to have a choice in the matter. I would have to use the money to buy drugs if I was going to make the deal. I wasn't allowed to use drugs because I am a drug addict, but that's not really the problem.

[ WP ] In a post apocalyptic world , a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball <endprompts> He was no saint. The world was still a mess. There was nothing but war. The war with the Aliens was all over the news. The leaders of the various countries had each other's backs. They were fighting against an enemy that was far more powerful than the world thought. It wasn't long before they had conquered more of the world than their enemies ever had. Their armies had conquered the land of humans and even conquered the people that they had taken, taking away their knowledge and forcing them into a sort of bondage, a slavery that only served to strengthen the soldiers. And as the leaders of the world continued to slaughter each other, their enemies continued to march onward. This wasn't the case for him. He had the ultimate goal to destroy the aliens. The only one capable of defeating them, was his friend The Mighty Magic Eight Ball. He wasn't a terrible person, but he wasn't very wise. When the aliens invaded, he had done his best to save humanity. He had made sure everyone had enough food, water, medicine, and even a basic shelter. That's how he kept his people alive. He had given them basic tools, but at a price. The soldiers he had sent to kill the aliens were completely ineffective. And there were even more of them, far more powerful than he ever thought possible. It was at this time that he started to notice something. The aliens had changed. They had changed and they had become more intelligent. They were almost intelligent enough to know he had taken this path. The war was ending soon and there was no way back for him. He had no way back to his homeland. It was the only choice left. But he didn't know why the aliens had taken over the world. They had come from another dimension to take us as slaves. And he didn't know how to defeat them. He wanted to be a hero to save the people.

He was young, yet it was clear that he would not be a child for long. His red hair, the color of moonlight, was in his mid-twenties, and his brown eyes, still glowing like the midnight sky, were only barely open. His mouth was dry and cold. His skin was ragged, his clothes old and faded. He was, as far as I was concerned, completely normal. <newline> <newline> I knew it was strange to hear such a thing from me, as I was the only one who was alive and aware, but it made sense at the same time. It was the last thing I needed to hear to understand the truth behind this. I had been a monster all my life. I had no memories of when I had been alive, just that I had done horrible things, and I had been the very worst. <newline> <newline> The monster in the closet had always looked out for me. I was scared of him, but in the end I had come to trust him, and he always stood by me. He had been there for me from the very beginning, and when he had found me, he had told me that this was all for the best. He was right. <newline> <newline> `` Goodnight sweetie. '' I said. `` It's going to be a long night. '' <newline> <newline> The sound of the door opening sounded like thunder in my ears, and he rose from his bed and walked over to the closet door. I opened the door and took a deep breath, expecting to find something out of the ordinary. Instead I saw what could only be described as a human skeleton.

Suicide, the end of days. The end of the world. It wasn't until the middle of February when he actually started talking. <newline> <newline> He was calling because his life had taken an unexpected turn, his wife, his two daughters, and his mother - whom he called, for a moment, his brother.

The war with the humans had caused an incredible exodus from this planet. The humans had been a terrible threat to the planets natural resources, and many of their soldiers had been taken into the galactic war. This left many young men in the middle of a barren and desolate world. The humans had been fighting in many fields, from the desert and the wastelands to the forests and the deep oceans.

After all he was just another child to the elders. He had never told anyone about his experiences in the war until he was old enough to understand what it was like to fight. He had fought in many battles, and he did not forget the pain of every man he had killed. He had to keep fighting because he did not want to be forgotten. And there were many soldiers in his age who did not want to be forgotten either. It was a shame. <newline> <newline> But today was the day he would do what he had to do. He would find the boy. <newline> <newline> He knew that the man that was sitting on the table next to him would not be him. He was not the type of man to show fear, or anger.

It was just a picture, just a picture at the most. And I 'd been watching the video feed for what seemed like days now. The girls seemed pretty, and they were going at it as much as they could, and then, the little girl took a swing at the swing, right between her eyes. I could see her face for the first time in a while, a strange, distorted reflection of me. `` Oh my god. '' I couldn't see her eyes ; she was so far away, like the other girl. But I saw her face in my own, and I couldn't look away. The little girl hit me with the swing, and I could feel the pain come back, like I 'd hit myself. I looked at the swing ; I could see the girls face, and I saw the way her hair was now covered in blood, and I could see the pain. I could see the girl's face. I could feel her face. <newline> <newline> I tried to move away, I felt the pain, but I couldn't get away. I looked to the group and saw them all looking at me. They were scared, but I didn't know how to move. So I just sat there, still. I was staring, in the corner, watching the video feed. But then, one of the girls looked at me. Her eyes were bloodshot and wet. The other girl looked at me as well. They both looked at each other.

He tried to close his eyes, but his eyes were covered by a dark hood, like some sort of mask, and he tried to shake it off, but nothing happened. He stood up and went over to the chair he sat at, sitting down on it and looking at the dark mask on his face. `` Who the hell is here? '' he asked to no one in particular. `` It's...

'' He stopped mid sentence, as his head started spinning. He had just seen his guests, his family, all of them smiling with a great deal of pride as they sat across from him. He didn't understand why everyone was smiling, but he just couldn't let go, not today. `` Please stop! '' He shouted. `` Stop? Why didn't you just say something?

Not because of some personal morality or anything like that, but because I knew that I could make a difference in someones life.

What could be worse than a woman with a smile on her face, and a body a bit bigger than mine? <newline> <newline> I had lived a life. In the past I 'd heard stories about the world in the distant past ; I was in a village where a man was given free reign to murder a woman on the spot, for fun. No one cared, of course, because there was nothing left in the world. It wasn't fair, of course ; women have always been better than men at everything. But still... It wasn't fair. I had lived a life, to be fair. <newline> <newline> Well, it's a long story, so take it slow. <newline> <newline> I was the oldest child in the village. We were all in my village, though everyone had their own family in the village. My mother and I lived in the town, but we did not have much money. I was the first and only child in this village. <newline> <newline> In the old days, I was a strong child. I loved to play, and my parents would always say that I was strong. We were strong in our village, and we had a strong home. I was only 8 years old, but in those days there was a lot of room to play and to have friends. <newline> <newline> That's when my father died. A boy I once was, a very strong boy. A young man who loved to play, and was very kind to others. He had a family of his own, and he was very happy.

The night seemed like it was all too bright and the birds chirped in the trees like they had done for years, but he felt different. He was different.

He couldn't remember what he had done in the night, but he knew that he had been in the kitchen, cleaning the oven, when it all changed. <newline> <newline> His father wouldn't answer his questions, he didn't know how, because he didn't remember seeing anything out of the ordinary.

His mother and father, he knew they were in shock, and his sister was crying, but there was no way they could tell what was happening. <newline> <newline> His father and brother came to pick him up, but he didn't know what they said. They told him about the stars, but he didn't understand it. They told him of the great cities, but he didn't understand them. They told him the weather, but he didn't understand what they meant. He was too young and too curious to understand. <newline> <newline> When they left him, he could see the stars, and all the stars, and all the stars, but the sun was so far away.

That was three years ago. He was eight when he died. <newline> <newline> <newline> It happened in a way that nobody, not his family or the police, or the coroner could have predicted. On the night of December 21st, 2015, a man broke into the house. <newline> <newline> He left a note that read, `` Don't look at me, '' but nobody saw the man. His eyes didn't look like those of a man who hasn't slept in six months. His mouth was crooked, and his cheeks were yellowed and scarred.

When the body was recovered, the police determined that the man had not died from natural causes. <newline> <newline> <newline> He had died by a ritual. <newline> <newline> <newline> The man, known as the Devil, was only four at the time of his death, but people thought him a dangerous man.

He wouldn't remember it all. The night he fell asleep on the floor of the room with the red lights on, he had been in a frenzy of playing on his tablet, when a sudden blinding light started to enter his eyes. It hurt, really, but he didn't know how much longer he could sit there. He wouldn't know if he would wake up or fall asleep again. He had no idea how long he would last. <newline> <newline> The only thing that made sense in the world as he fell asleep were the little lights that were starting to light up the room. He could see them, though he could not see his eyes, the little light lights were pulsing on and off, they were like little little red dots on the screen in front of him. They were blinking, and there were some colors, some colors he couldn't quite make out, but it felt good. <newline> <newline> After a while the lights stopped flashing, and the room seemed to fill with a gentle glow. He felt his vision go blank. The bright lights on and off started to fade, and he began to feel tired. He didn't remember falling asleep in the first place. He didn't know if he would wake up in the room again. He didn't know if his eyes would blink. He could feel his mind going blank. He had to try again. <newline> <newline> He started running his fingers along the edge of the pillow. He felt the cool, wet surface beneath him. He was starting to like the feel. He could feel the way the light felt against the back of his neck, and the pressure of the pillows, but he didn't know why he felt the way he felt. He didn't know if he was dreaming. He hadn't been dreaming. <newline>

First, he 'd gone to bed on the floor of the room with his parents. That was pretty irresponsible, but it was also the best bed they had to offer. Next he 'd played with his toys and tried to find a quiet spot to hide. Finally, he 'd tried to kill himself. The only way to really get away was to be completely sure that he wasn't going to try it again. <newline> <newline> The moment he 'd made that first choice, he 'd heard a voice calling his name.

It was no longer a mere whisper : it was the most potent language in existence, and yet, it remained a strange, elusive, and unknown thing. There was no one who was able to pronounce it out loud. They had no idea who uttered it or what it said. They only knew that there was a voice, one that was different every time it was uttered, and yet they never heard it again. <newline> <newline> It was only when he grew older, that he realised the implications of what he was hearing.

The lake was empty, and a single boat lay idly there, seemingly abandoned. The water was shallow and murky, and the only source of illumination was the soft and glowing red light that emanated from the lamp on the boat's side. As he approached the boat, he could see the outline of the mouth moving out of the shadows of the water. It was as though it was breathing. <newline> <newline> When he spoke the words, they came from behind the lake, and he saw them echo back into his ears. It was a foreign language that he did not understand. He understood the language of those who had heard it, and yet, there was another language he did not know. <newline> <newline> When he spoke again, he felt the familiar warm blood rushing to his throat and the sharp pain in his chest. A small tear streamed down the inside of his face, and the pressure was unbearable. <newline> <newline> It was then that he realised that the voice had spoken to him. <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>

I know I'm on the side of a small island in the middle of the ocean and it's dark, but I know that it's somewhere that I need to be, so I move my legs towards the lighthouse. I reach the light switch and press it. It's a bright, brilliant light coming from the lighthouse. At first, I'm confused at how this can even work. How could a lighthouse work? I can't see any of the lights coming from the lighthouse so there must be something off, but when I turn the light on, I see a bright glowing object floating above the ocean. As soon as I turn it off, the lighthouse starts glowing brighter and brighter until I feel a warm beam coming from the lighthouse. As I'm walking towards the lighthouse, the beam of light disappears. I try to run away, but the light keeps coming. I try to keep my hands free but they are bound behind me.

I frantically try to get my hand free but it's trapped in my hands. I reach down and pull myself free of my hand. As I move forward, I catch my hand, but the light is gone. I look around me to see who or what is making this happen. Nothing. I look down and realize that I'm sitting on a stone platform in the middle of the ocean.

He wouldn't remember it all. It was a mere memory, the sort of memory that only gets stored in the back of a head in a hospital.

They looked at each other with such a blank expression I couldn't even tell them who they were. One of these souls wasn't even breathing.

When I returned, I found the man was unconscious, blood was coming from his mouth, and his body was lying next to a fire pit, next to what looked like a child who had a needle stuck in his mouth.
