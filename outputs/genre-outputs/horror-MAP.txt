western||[ WP ] Use a Civ 5 ( or any civ ) game you 've played to inspire a story . <endprompts> **Siege** <newline> <newline> The enemy was fast, strong, and, above all else, determined. The entire army, no matter where they were in the mountains, would fight until the last man. Not even after they were wiped out, when they only had the resources for themselves. `` Our victory, '' their generals had declared, `` shall be a triumph for mankind. '' To the common men, though, to the brave, and valiant, their victory was merely an affront to the gods. `` Our defeat, '' their warriors had proclaimed, `` shall be the end of the species. '' When they had been routed, their entire armies, their bodies, lay scattered, on barren, desolate, barren ground, no matter how long they had survived. No, even after they were done, when they were forced from their homes, no matter how far they had survived, they would never escape. And to know that, and see themselves, torn apart, dead, no matter how much time they had, only made the enemy's blood boil. Even in the face of this, he knew they had failed. `` We are doomed, '' the enemy's commander's men had declared, `` this is our victory, '' and in the face of the enemy's ultimate failure, the entire army, even his men, would rise. `` What was a mistake, '' they had argued, `` was a single, fatal misstep. '' They had called it a mistake, but it hadn't been, and so they had gone.
