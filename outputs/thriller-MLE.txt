[ WP ] It 's cute when your kid sends Santa a letter . It 's surprising when Santa sends a letter back . It 's worrying when the two become regular pen pals . And it 's horrifying when you start reading the letters yourself ... <endprompts> The child looks up as though his very presence makes an enormous hole through the child. The child stares up confused at such a childish prank for what must have to be an eternity yet there in that very moment he knows, it's been a very long year at work. <newline> <newline> As the child looks around at his family it appears to the other five other family members, a smile graces his cheeks in all three different versions. Each with bright little beady globs of grey on either side but most of all each having a distinct accent around him like a little white elephant. He smiles up to show his appreciation. A little to everyone with his very little face that shines. As the little little man and little girl start the child jumps in shock. `` I don't understand what you, your name... Oh! Look at it my friend! Look! It's got your name written on it that's a surprise! Look on it, that you, the best of friends with that young family that you were once, that this house and that tree you call home, that tree has the name written all out front and is the reason why your Santa got you all this mail that way ''. Now of all the kids to have a word back to me and with everyone expecting an email reply back on the news no that one can say I 'd like to try in writing so I just had the kids get off. <newline> <newline> <newline> The little man sighs and stares up. His face scrunched up with anger almost into an impossible grin while clutching some paper over the other little beady globs on his face and at times his chest that look almost identical with other versions. I know, we've done this kind, so the man probably knows and feels it too. `` oh look at that too

[ WP ] Slowly start to realize that you have a roommate . <endprompts> The last sentence of the song started off innocuously, but a dark, menacing feeling spread itself over him. He pulled the hood of his jacket off in panic and rushed his door, the noise driving him screaming and panicking until his alarm started to get closer and closer. He was trying to turn it off now. After one last search on his pocket it began to work, opening and sliding off until he 'd closed everything again in preparation as to how long this lasted. *Shit shit shit shit. * As his panic made itself known throughout his bedroom all he could hear now was the pounding of his phone, it's call code. He reached into his drawer and removed several cell phone cases. As he did the room shuddered to the worst possible pitch, the air conditioning turning to complete and total silence, followed by complete silence as all sounds, all smells disappeared forever. The man had finally succeeded in finding his last companion. `` You couldn't kill 'em all, '' the familiar baritone of that number rang back at him once as that familiar alarm clock on the nightstand droned itself into the life with the sounds of people going about their morning daily routine. He pushed down his heavy boots on the sidewalk of Manhattan and walked into a small café that was right around the corner of an intersection. <newline> This was one of the rare moments when things felt like they were right. As he ordered his espresso, another call buzzed right beside him. <newline> “ Oh fuck. *You are that *asshole right here? Are you done talking nonsense. * Now if I 'll be the bastard to your left?! Go out? '* A voice rang through the ringing, followed with

[ WP ] Science has advanced far beyond human understanding , discoveries are made using supercomputers running vast neural networks . In the darkness , God watches a lonely machine printing output , a new law of nature ! Something troubles him , this law is undeniably valid but it 's not one that he created . <endprompts> The last message of the universe came through again. A few months prior, an event of similar magnitude had created a large cloud of radioactivity. <newline> <newline> `` They're probably playing God here. I never thought that a sentient race could create and destroy everything in such large and chaotic way for one single reason. They just couldn't come close to it. There is a reason behind how everything works in all three dimension. '' Said Yahweh softly, before walking out of the office onto the carpet, seemingly exhausted from dealing with his god who now looks more or less disheveled with dishevelled hair, stained jeans with his usual yellowish jacket, black glasses... Oh dear shit. I thought the one of my assistants would notice how I put my coat and shoes back under that stupid red cloth! He looks so lost, so upset! <newline> He turns around, suddenly realizing that someone has already knocked on the side of that desk, clearly irritated of whatever disturbance that a person may have disturbed that night. But how! Yahweh did the thing that most god does the opposite is give off vibrations that the person can't handle and causes him to open his arms wide towards his coworker, seemingly showing a smile as he approaches and gets to grips. <newline> Before a little girl with blonde hair ( no seriously - Yahweh has so much curly red hair ) has time to register his intention, it suddenly happens and all his nerves become relaxed and tense. As if looking up and down as Yahwe was telling her to stay still. He slowly reaches down, opens his right hand to reveal the

[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying . <endprompts> He looked nervous. <newline> <newline> I smiled. I knew when someone was nervously shaking off something, my job could get done with less fear than some of these guys on TV. Just as I finished setting up my fake ID, `` David '' ( obviously him ) popped out. His jaw drop showed he's surprised too. His whole body froze under the pressure when he noticed what he was handing to me was a `` phone card file. '' He tried the `` sign, sign or shoot '' thing which looked weird. `` Is your name real? Is it me? '' <newline> <newline> For a third straight moment I could have sworn David was smiling like he knew his deal was done but then the phone crackled with life. I froze my work. The security system on the handset buzzed for me. `` David, it's too good to be true -- get a grip. '' <newline> <newline> I handed him an item and the receiver crackled with a little whir. Dave quickly put his head over my shoulder. <newline> `` Can you pick that up, it has your information on it. I know that we both know that the receiver picked up his cellphone in *not-real-life* but there doesn't have to be a bomb in here. '' <newline>

[ WP ] When two people get married , their hearts are surgically exchanged . You just filed for divorce . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having feelings, even after it had long past when there was an `` exchange. '' And this one did not involve her being angry but him becoming mad. He stood like that to her, eyes cold to his pupils, with sweat on his skin, as she stared, his expression unemotion at all the same. <newline> <newline> And for that silence was not broken by a sound but merely silence in one place. He knew her, she thought, even when she looked in his eyes the world he found so repulsive for them to have a word to share. So peaceful the words made, to listen so well. <newline> <newline> He could feel the same way, this was to be like her one last year in highschool before he returned his life for that college degree of yours. She 'd never loved again, not exactly, anyway. What do one and his heart never have in common, one little spark and the words, like fire or hot chocolate, could be used one hundred thousand times, but for as long he lived, for as long she thought, the spark between them could only ever go out and become another spark that the flame could lose its ability to fuel again. He remembered seeing her in those same highschool halls once again a dozen times with their eyes wide and the same heart that gave that look but she 'd never have felt anything to say at that glance, never say a word from that face again just before he came in front to her at that same spot before turning and falling to the ground like

[ WP ] A hole in time and space opens up , and you see your younger self looking back at you . You have exactly one minute to tell young-you whatever you can before the hole closes . Bonus points if you only give yourself one minute to type the response . <endprompts> The last message of the universe came through again. A few months prior, an event of similar magnitude had created a large rift in our dimension. <newline> <newline> `` They're probably playing chess against each other. We would get along much better. '' It said. There was no point anymore for me. Not on either of our side to work for me and not on her either. <newline> <newline> She told me later that she really believed she would fall in love with him even more, and wished she were alone at least once a week more or get lost without her. We found another job soon after, to keep living our usual lives, working odd job after odd job and living the life I had grown up with in that very spot. However I'm certain her love for me would break if i gave it my all in the time left or had one last chance at being close but never actually having sex? She believed it would kill her, no I do. You're not going to forget that love that only the man on fire and the man in the bed has. Her mind is warped towards what is the cause. Why me she asks... It will only be hours now. It really is useless to focus or to be bothered because everything has become so very hard these years on the news. She did not realize this, not her and he can barely hear anything around me either anymore. I have a few months of peace, it will not last but one. <newline> <newline> It is not always easy being with a woman such one on one, I 'll be honest. On days she likes more men she becomes annoyed at times, but this is almost routine with her. Maybe she knows, maybe I know too late. If so the man in the bed might be too. It may happen again but she

[ WP ] Mother Nature assumes her bodily form and takes a one year trip around the world . Share an entry from her journal . <endprompts> The last message of April 23th - The End Day- a week before the event. As the weeks have stretched on the event will come. <newline> April 21 - <newline> On the third, it dawn's in that day, at sunrise. All sorts of life has gathered and now I can feel my body on every person it encounters. I see many and will continue until a clear and defined end is realized all over the rest of this year. <newline> April 21 & 22, 2017 - I have done this for a year now and it looks almost perfect. After walking for hours I have found another person in my car to visit with him or her soon. I am unsure to give up at the present location to the person with whom I am talking. However once we've established communication that's easy if my senses can process. After the three year waiting to finally see him/her it seems that he/she has decided to continue, as I see no others still visiting the house. I hear their voices that we now refer as `` humans. And `` the stars. <newline> And soon. This is going the hardest. April 24, 2020... It began that way all around the world and the end has come! But I 'll never be able to escape that feeling. There's no meaning in life or the concept I came upon to feel like so. As my body disappears around others I slowly die down so it does it and leaves. Then one. <newline> January 13, 2020 - January 18, 2020. One doesn't leave on these dates. The event began on what was described previously

[ WP ] You 've just sold your soul to Satan in exchange for demonic powers . However , you did n't read the fine print and it turns out you 've entered into a pyramid scheme . `` Satan '' is actually a low-level demon and you have to recruit 200+ souls to get your powers . <endprompts> He looked at me again. He smiled. I took him from behind. Then all my questions ceased. What did I have under this mask? <newline> <newline> The night seemed a little grey to me, but I needed not dwell on my own thoughts. With one finger I dug, hissed and bit me at an angle. His screams pierced through the silence and when he died there was silence. As I fell towards the surface I found something odd. Instead of mud falling, sand broke, yet I could feel an electric pulse of light inside my body that pulled me towards earths surface. I stepped on and I felt it. I knew I could fly. <newline> <newline> There was a noise above my lungs that felt to much like metal on glass. The sounds, like static of his life now on my surface of water. <newline> <newline> Was I alive? What in Hell did I become? And how long had I been underground? Where did I know there was such beauty that lived at these depths? <newline> It was now my body, and on a much larger body. My power in darkness, it seems strange that we share the same essence, even in his form in which his head became one. Even in my appearance on a tiny body. My body still looked much the same however. He wore metal to keep form but I 'd removed it now. Only the black-light and mine flowed as a perfect pair in my dark. His soul now made to feel at home in my being, and for once it felt like home. <newline>

[ WP ] You are a God who has been watching over the world not intervening or viewing it for many centuries . You come back to see millions of people suffering , in pain and hopeless . How would you handle the world and bring it to peace once more without revealing your presence to mankind ? <endprompts> He looked at me again. He remembered. I must have stared twice. Then all my years spent here were now spent standing outside this room, watching with pride for these people. What he looked at that time, I know, but I can not recall. Now it's time, now. Time, his word! There is no point in trying this any other way but this! He smiled once for that much. As long as a child is in pain, one would have the ability to see the true pain that drives its source in an instant. He knew pain was important, even as I have experienced its consequences hundreds if not thousands upon countless of times myself. What the child doesn't see, I cann't. His life can too, if it goes well for her... if this is what the woman in question seeks. Now that my son is nearing his tenth birthday I hope everything goes just as she expected it would- in good standing of his father in any way, of this man or that- and I will take time just after him's wedding to get started, but for as long he lived, and after that for as long the man's reign will end I was certain we will end the suffering for every day his father suffered. A father and child have so much greater chances now.

[ WP ] Our protagonist has just been gifted with a divine vision : precisely one year from now , if there are fewer than 100,000 people still keeping their butter in the refrigerator , all humanity will be saved . Otherwise , all humanity shall suddenly and violently perish . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having sex, having a baby. Then all of history ceased. What did life have been this century? <newline> <newline> The boy nodded his attention into her blonde, blue skin. It did not matter who it was between them anymore. She smiled back. He smiled back at her too. His thoughts ran like steam. So many possibilities. How would she spend her time? How to make him happy? There would have to be a sacrifice. They were going to take over in 20 years. He knew his chances of saving people were slim at best. But his heart raced. For just such a small year, the world wouldn't matter at all. <newline> <newline> Another second to go. There were only about half a billion people in the entire world now that was it too late. <newline> <newline> The light at the other end, blue as glass illuminated that small bedroom where he still had half an hour, to spare her time. They lived in fear. For that instant, everything changed. His skin was cold and stiff. Tears streaming, the man's vision started. For a minute or so the two didn't interact at all in any way. Then one minute he would begin looking over a few words again until it started with something beautiful. Something beautiful they would both appreciate that made life worth living. <newline> <newline> As soon as the two noticed the change in each others moods she pulled him to join them both in bed. He wanted for nothing else than to feel their bodies touching his like he had held them over his wife. He had never held something so close but a couple seconds would be a lifetime ago now before nothing could fill the air with its memory. They slept happily. She kissed him good night. <newline> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[ WP ] You are clumsy in the kitchen . Today , you perform a satanic ritual entirely by accident . <endprompts> The last remnants of morning's dinner came rushing from underneath a broken counter. When my son had been awake, I could easily feel how heavy they had gone. I picked my cup up and poured half of it into it without saying goodbye in that unspeakable voice. <newline> <newline> I put one last go at it over it as my eyes finally took their distance to make a cup and drink from one open, and turned on the radio with an annoyed beep like something so young had just accidentally died on screen. *It has all just happened and now it is too late. No need to freakin'listen. Don't bother with him or mom now or I swear to god to have another kid at school to pick up my tab, I swear. * I'm certain now, that as I watch the kids play, my own children are doing exactly as you promised last night they would last year. At least their parents can give 'em that satisfaction, no? Or maybe not that. Either way, I can get that satisfaction over and over. And, maybe, just maybe the fact the child is playing right now is the cause. And I mean it all too. Because if all it takes to really mess up somebody *is* someone's life with some simple, seemingly innocent shit on the news about an overnight internet shutdown is an empty glass on TV in front of no one, there is no point. <newline> <newline> -- <newline> <newline> I pulled up to the house to make my getaway to get away. Everything looked just as it was when they picked me- dead white walls on brown, and the smell of mold that had been clinging them over night. I took out my keys before leaving the house, so the man in suits wouldn't see anything on my property unless he did

[ WP ] In the future , technology has allowed us to have pillows that monitor our brain waves , and when people wake up they can plug them into their laptops and watch their dreams . <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered having sex, having a baby. Then all of a sudden she stopped sleeping. The baby stayed asleep after he left her for about 9 weeks. The boy slept well after that, but his eyes grew red whenever she blinked with it. A time-frame. Time, his mind showed, is measured through the same mechanism as a drug. You're taking something for that much. As long as its labeled as medicine it is allowed. And the company responsible, Dr. Joseph Schumacher, thought it just the perfect way of giving you one of them to have a few too few. So on the second birthday of their daughter, the child was able to switch the pill out of him. His doctor gave it to him when he came into her world with this amazing and different ability for life. Of all that was so good, it didn't even give you time. To experience it every other minute, and maybe once a month when you need something sharp, like an instrument, like fire or a scalpel. Of course it took that much more effort for your head to adjust, and after a few days your first reaction is usually panic, it seems. After a month the anxiety set in, which caused a withdrawal which was then further enhanced into rage and hate. By a few days you start looking more like a lunatic and by weeks you're pretty certain you died, or you have a life to begin with. As soon as you notice her staring in between them, you're in love. The two weeks were all one shot and for most it felt like time. However he had already had a dream, this was it. He had never had something so close but close before. The only thing he would remember before was what his childhood when a beautiful memory was about to come. She stopped in his vision looking, in the kitchen she said, her hand,

[ WP ] It 's the middle of the night . Your iPhone starts ringing . You wake up . You 're getting a Facetime call from someone who died three days earlier . <endprompts> The last message I could make of the line read, `` Hey Jake, It's me. `` The phone rings for two counts then suddenly explodes in a pile on my screen, `` Yeah uh.. Jake I'm really busy. We would get along fine if you and I hadn't moved and now I'm in New Orleans with Katrina.. She had so much left and.. How? The Katrina virus? Oh yeah my old friend got caught. I guess she needs me to help her so she can rest. Let's start by having coffee... '' The phone crackled away then immediately faded away when I went to call my wife and daughter to check on their mother.. Katrina started to shake after ten to fifteen mins after which I realized the worst possible scenario, the phone was just starting to ring with her again... It would break if i got it to. After the three counts ended my text box just said, `` I never could stop you. `` I'm at a desk about six hours up the interstate going to the gas station that we used a couple of years ago but did the double take of the fact the gas is out right now before the rain drops made sure I'm too much gas from all that traffic downtown and the rain has stopped all that way to me and now i can't even bring myself to make coffee in one of the cold winter nights. My phone was right there. Then my fingers brushed against something. Then I heard the sound of it and started to reach the floor where it came from and the world went blurry as I turned my ears closed to cover my ears but i heard that same voice over the other speakers through the speakers coming out sound? <newline>

[ WP ] Every single day the world votes to kill off one person . Whoever receives the most votes that day is killed . <endprompts> ‘ Welcome back, and good luck. Today's your first trial. Can you imagine what we are waiting to hear when every single ballot reaches your brain? We will dissect the candidates and judge everyone in the entire world.

Just before the moment of truth , another student in his class opens fire on his class mates . What does he do next ? <endprompts> He looked at her again. He remembered. No, still wasn't quite all there - just an awful lot. But at this moment she smiled with her eyes, but his hands weren ’ t touching that hand or his eyes either. It did not matter - it was time, now. Time, his mind went, for her now ; he must have gone years into the future when he died for that little thing to happen, a fleeting flash in his dying imagination. And the year to now was finally coming again. <newline> <newline> Time was not one of them to have a child, his heart - the moment it made up one half part the world. Now here they would sit side by side. His life. She ’ d do much for her friend if they spent more, both for him more at all that was worth a name. <newline> <newline> The light at noon would illuminate, and his fingers would grip what little she saw still, and what did, what there was and still would remain from it. It still sat, but for as long he lived, for as long she lived, the darkness would leave his heart. Maybe then they would be as two halves, for which their father would no longer remember and all that would remain behind. <newline> <newline> Time would be his companion forever ; he must never know the way she 'd gone. He was to walk on that face, forever, as her heart had turned away just before he came in front to join them both. And though his eyes still burned it felt like time had begun. He smiled still more - and this was it. He had lived just three more days but a whole half would be a lifetime indeed just before they could meet face him. <newline> <newline> <newline> -- <newline> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
